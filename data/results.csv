"Starbelly is always a solid stop for a meal in the Castro. I came here for dinner during Pride weekend and it was busy but still not a long wait to get a table. The cocktails were strong, the food was flavorful and fresh. We got the thai spiced pork sausage (tasty bites), the white bean puré (creamy!), and the spahgetti (solid) along with the steak skewer (a great bite) Will definitely be coming back on my next visit.","starbelly is always a solid stop for a meal in the castro. i came here for dinner during pride weekend and it was busy but still not a long wait to get a table. the cocktails were strong, the food was flavorful and fresh. we got the thai spiced pork sausage (tasty bites), the white bean puré (creamy!), and the spahgetti (solid) along with the steak skewer (a great bite) will definitely be coming back on my next visit.",starbelly is always a solid stop for a meal in the castro i came here for dinner during pride weekend and it was busy but still not a long wait to get a table the cocktails were strong the food was flavorful and fresh we got the thai spiced pork sausage tasty bites the white bean puré creamy and the spahgetti solid along with the steak skewer a great bite will definitely be coming back on my next visit,starbelly always solid stop meal castro came dinner pride weekend busy still long wait get table cocktails strong food flavorful fresh got thai spiced pork sausage tasty bites white bean puré creamy spahgetti solid along steak skewer great bite definitely coming back next visit,starbelly always solid stop meal castro dinner pride weekend busy still long wait table cocktails strong food flavorful fresh thai spiced pork sausage tasty bites white bean puré creamy spahgetti solid along steak skewer great bite definitely coming back next visit,starbelly always solid stop meal castro dinner pride weekend busy still long wait table cocktail strong food flavorful fresh thai spiced pork sausage tasty bite white bean puré creamy spahgetti solid along steak skewer great bite definitely coming back next visit,0.14393939393939392,0.30757575757575756
"Stopped by for a late brunch in the Castro and overall enjoyed the experience.The weekend brunch menu is creative with enough variety. I recommend the French toast and their spring gazpacho was refreshing. The house (Starbelly) salad was average, but I think people come here for the multiple cocktail options for happy hour.I appreciate their heated outdoor seating, and indoor space is also quite welcoming. Service was nice and attentive.","stopped by for a late brunch in the castro and overall enjoyed the experience.the weekend brunch menu is creative with enough variety. i recommend the french toast and their spring gazpacho was refreshing. the house (starbelly) salad was average, but i think people come here for the multiple cocktail options for happy hour.i appreciate their heated outdoor seating, and indoor space is also quite welcoming. service was nice and attentive.",stopped by for a late brunch in the castro and overall enjoyed the experiencethe weekend brunch menu is creative with enough variety i recommend the french toast and their spring gazpacho was refreshing the house starbelly salad was average but i think people come here for the multiple cocktail options for happy houri appreciate their heated outdoor seating and indoor space is also quite welcoming service was nice and attentive,stopped late brunch castro overall enjoyed experiencethe weekend brunch menu creative enough variety recommend french toast spring gazpacho refreshing house starbelly salad average think people come multiple cocktail options happy houri appreciate heated outdoor seating indoor space also quite welcoming service nice attentive,stopped late brunch castro overall enjoyed experiencethe weekend brunch menu creative enough variety recommend french toast spring gazpacho refreshing house starbelly salad average think people come multiple cocktail options happy houri appreciate heated outdoor seating indoor space also quite welcoming service nice attentive,stopped late brunch castro overall enjoyed experiencethe weekend brunch menu creative enough variety recommend french toast spring gazpacho refreshing house starbelly salad average think people come multiple cocktail option happy houri appreciate heated outdoor seating indoor space also quite welcoming service nice attentive,0.23750000000000002,0.5916666666666667
"Cutest place, sat outside in the back and the heaters are abundant, so you will not get cold. Ordered micheladas and a couple other cocktails and all were great. The food is on point, every single thing was so yummy. We ordered the Starbelly bacon pizza, the green goddess sauce on it is a game changer, so good. The other item you must order is the chicken and French toast, everyone at the table tried it and loved it.

"Starbelly is one of those places that feels like home away from home. It is on the intersection in the Castro neighborhood and there is street parking available on the weekdays. Finding parking was easy and we were able to walk around to see some shops.Arriving at happy hour, there is a display with a huge array of drinks behind the counter. We were greeted by the happy manager Adam and we encountered a couple who told us that Starbelly's pizza is something to die for. Starbelly provided some cool tones inside. My friend and I sat in the patio that has a covering on the top with star decorations on the walls. It was nice that the heater was on. Some nights in San Francisco can get pretty chilly.The server Chris (I hope I spelled their name correctly) was very kind and inviting. She was very patient when we asked about specific ingredients from the menu.My friend went for the burger and fries during happy hour and I ate margarita pizza. The couple was right. The pizza was fantastic and it wasn't salty compared to some places I have visited in San Francisco. The French fries were crunchy and I love it.I think what makes this place so attractive is that people like Adam and Chris make sure that your experience is memorable. In tough days or just an exploration, they invite you to return to their humble and charming restaurant. I just wished I took a picture of the food but we got so hungry that the food has been demolished in less than a minute.Thank you for having us here, Adam! We will come back again. :)","starbelly is one of those places that feels like home away from home. it is on the intersection in the castro neighborhood and there is street parking available on the weekdays. finding parking was easy and we were able to walk around to see some shops.arriving at happy hour, there is a display with a huge array of drinks behind the counter. we were greeted by the happy manager adam and we encountered a couple who told us that starbelly's pizza is something to die for. starbelly provided some cool tones inside. my friend and i sat in the patio that has a covering on the top with star decorations on the walls. it was nice that the heater was on. some nights in san francisco can get pretty chilly.the server chris (i hope i spelled their name correctly) was very kind and inviting. she was very patient when we asked about specific ingredients from the menu.my friend went for the burger and fries during happy hour and i ate margarita pizza. the couple was right. the pizza was fantastic and it wasn't salty compared to some places i have visited in san francisco. the french fries were crunchy and i love it.i think what makes this place so attractive is that people like adam and chris make sure that your experience is memorable. in tough days or just an exploration, they invite you to return to their humble and charming restaurant. i just wished i took a picture of the food but we got so hungry that the food has been demolished in less than a minute.thank you for having us here, adam!

Food is great and simple! No frills- we got CHF i Ken and waffles and the salad with grilled chicken. Portion for the salad was quite small. But fresh. Prices are great.

"Starbelly is a neighborhood gem that needs to be a part of everyone's regular rotation. It's a great option for a weeknight burger and fries, but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving. The bacon pizza is so scrumptious. The crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over. The arugula adds a nice peppery touch. This specific night I decided to try the Toffee Cake, and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream, which was the Chocolate Caramel Crackle--the two together was AMAZING. I'm going back just for that dessert combo.","starbelly is a neighborhood gem that needs to be a part of everyone's regular rotation. it's a great option for a weeknight burger and fries, but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving. the bacon pizza is so scrumptious. the crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over. the arugula adds a nice peppery touch. this specific night i decided to try the toffee cake, and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream, which was the chocolate caramel crackle--the two together was amazing. i'm going back just for that dessert combo.",starbelly is a neighborhood gem that needs to be a part of everyones regular rotation its a great option for a weeknight burger and fries but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving the bacon pizza is so scrumptious the crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over the arugula adds a nice peppery touch this specific night i decided to try the toffee cake and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream which was the chocolate caramel cracklethe two together was amazing im going back just for that dessert combo,starbelly neighborhood gem needs part everyones regular rotation great option weeknight burger fries star weeknight pizza craving bacon pizza scrumptious crispy crust melty cheese crisp bacon combo salivate arugula adds nice peppery touch specific night decided try toffee cake added scoop seasonal ice cream chocolate caramel cracklethe two together amazing im going back dessert combo,starbelly neighborhood gem needs part everyones regular rotation great option weeknight burger fries star weeknight pizza craving bacon pizza scrumptious crispy crust melty cheese crisp bacon combo salivate arugula adds nice peppery touch specific night decided toffee cake added scoop seasonal ice cream chocolate caramel cracklethe two together amazing going back dessert combo,starbelly neighborhood gem need part everyones regular rotation great option weeknight burger fry star weeknight pizza craving bacon pizza scrumptious crispy crust melty cheese crisp bacon combo salivate arugula add nice peppery touch specific night decided toffee cake added scoop seasonal ice cream chocolate caramel cracklethe two together amazing going back dessert combo,0.26875,0.47107371794871794
"One of my favorite places in San Francisco to have delicious & beautiful food with wonderful cocktails.

"In the heart of the Castro, there's outdoor seating, bar seating & a hidden patio in the back. Well-designed interior & you can see the chefs prepare your food as well! I went on a tuesday lunch &  I thought it was empty until I saw a full patioMy friends and I went for the restaurant week deal and we got:- chicken liver pate: one of their best appetizers by far, the whole grain mustard, marmalade & the cut of bread gave a carnival of flavors in my mouth! It made me eager to try the rest of the deal- fries & 3 dips : The fries were nothing special. The basil aioli was light and refreshing but could have used a bit of parmesan or salt. The old bay aioli could have used a lot more seasoning as well. The last dip was ketchup- fried chicken po'boy: really more of a fried chicken sandwich, surprised it came on a brioche. Buns were toasted though and it was a great bread to soak up the flavor but that leads me to the next part: it had no flavor.  The texture & cook were perfect but the juicy chicken had no seasoning, and the slaw was lacking (could have used more). I was putting the trio dips on my sandwich to compensate but it was not enough. I get that this place is more focused on healthy clean food but there are ways to incorporate more flavors!This is an amazing place to dine at but it failed to deliver on flavor. I am willing to come back another day to try the rest of the menu but I left feeling very dissapointed","in the heart of the castro, there's outdoor seating, bar seating & a hidden patio in the back.

"Had a reservation for 2 on a Sunday night at 5:30, plenty of space, so I was seated immediately. The space has a really nice dimmed lighting, creating a great intimate space for small groups. Ordered the broccoli rapini, flavor was great but a bit salty and extremely oily. Asked for half vegan cheese on the pizza and they accommodated! It was really good, crispy and thin crust just how I like it! Managed to finish all of it with 2 people. Although I just realized that the arugula we ordered did not get added on top of the pizza and I forgot to mention it since we were so hungry! Regardless it was a pleasant experience and appreciated them for catering to my sensitive stomach!","had a reservation for 2 on a sunday night at 5:30, plenty of space, so i was seated immediately. the space has a really nice dimmed lighting, creating a great intimate space for small groups. ordered the broccoli rapini, flavor was great but a bit salty and extremely oily. asked for half vegan cheese on the pizza and they accommodated! it was really good, crispy and thin crust just how i like it! managed to finish all of it with 2 people. although i just realized that the arugula we ordered did not get added on top of the pizza and i forgot to mention it since we were so hungry! regardless it was a pleasant experience and appreciated them for catering to my sensitive stomach!",had a reservation for 2 on a sunday night at 530 plenty of space so i was seated immediately the space has a really nice dimmed lighting creating a great intimate space for small groups ordered the broccoli rapini flavor was great but a bit salty and extremely oily asked for half vegan cheese on the pizza and they accommodated it was really good crispy and thin crust just how i like it managed to finish all of it with 2 people although i just realized that the arugula we ordered did not get added on top of the pizza and i forgot to mention it since we were so hungry regardless it was a pleasant experience and appreciated them for catering to my sensitive stomach,reservation 2 sunday night 530 plenty space seated immediately space really nice dimmed lighting creating great intimate space small groups ordered broccoli rapini flavor great bit salty extremely oily asked half vegan cheese pizza accommodated really good crispy thin crust like managed finish 2 people although realized arugula ordered get added top pizza forgot mention since hungry regardless pleasant experience appreciated catering sensitive stomach,reservation 2 sunday night 530 plenty space seated immediately space really nice dimmed lighting creating great intimate space small groups ordered broccoli rapini flavor great bit salty extremely oily asked half vegan cheese pizza accommodated really good crispy thin crust like managed finish 2 people although realized arugula ordered added top pizza forgot mention since hungry regardless pleasant experience appreciated catering sensitive stomach,reservation 2 sunday night 530 plenty space seated immediately space really nice dimmed lighting creating great intimate space small group ordered broccoli rapini flavor great bit salty extremely oily asked half vegan cheese pizza accommodated really good crispy thin crust like managed finish 2 people although realized arugula ordered added top pizza forgot mention since hungry regardless pleasant experience appreciated catering sensitive stomach,0.28397435897435896,0.6602564102564104
"Came here for a casual 3 person brunch on a Thursday and loved everything we ordered! We were seated outdoors immediately and loved the ambiance of the front outdoor area + the heaters overhead. The portions were huge, especially the fried chicken and French toast, which I only finished half of and took the rest home to eat later. The french toast was so spongey and not too sweet, which paired perfectly with the crispness of the chicken. I got the lychee cocktail which was very sweet and delicious! Id recommend getting the fries because they had three great dipping sauces.","came here for a casual 3 person brunch on a thursday and loved everything we ordered! we were seated outdoors immediately and loved the ambiance of the front outdoor area + the heaters overhead. the portions were huge, especially the fried chicken and french toast, which i only finished half of and took the rest home to eat later. the french toast was so spongey and not too sweet, which paired perfectly with the crispness of the chicken. i got the lychee cocktail which was very sweet and delicious! id recommend getting the fries because they had three great dipping sauces.",came here for a casual 3 person brunch on a thursday and loved everything we ordered we were seated outdoors immediately and loved the ambiance of the front outdoor area  the heaters overhead the portions were huge especially the fried chicken and french toast which i only finished half of and took the rest home to eat later the french toast was so spongey and not too sweet which paired perfectly with the crispness of the chicken i got the lychee cocktail which was very sweet and delicious id recommend getting the fries because they had three great dipping sauces,came casual 3 person brunch thursday loved everything ordered seated outdoors immediately loved ambiance front outdoor area heaters overhead portions huge especially fried chicken french toast finished half took rest home eat later french toast spongey sweet paired perfectly crispness chicken got lychee cocktail sweet delicious id recommend getting fries three great dipping sauces,casual 3 person brunch thursday loved everything ordered seated outdoors immediately loved ambiance front outdoor area heaters overhead portions huge especially fried chicken french toast finished half took rest home eat later french toast spongey sweet paired perfectly crispness chicken lychee cocktail sweet delicious id recommend getting fries three great dipping sauces,casual 3 person brunch thursday loved everything ordered seated outdoors immediately loved ambiance front outdoor area heater overhead portion huge especially fried chicken french toast finished half took rest home eat later french toast spongey sweet paired perfectly crispness chicken lychee cocktail sweet delicious id recommend getting fry three great dipping sauce,0.21458333333333335,0.6552083333333334

"3.5 STARS- the storefront makes the restaurant seem deceptively small, but once inside you can see just how much seating there is, as well as in the backyard patio- the interior is really cute and the ambiance is nice, lots of conversation and noise- we went on a tuesday for lunch and though the outdoor and indoor seating were empty, the patio was pretty full- my friends and i went for the restaurant week deal and we got:- chicken liver pate (5/5): this was the best dish we got! the pate was creamy and flavorful, the bread was thick cut, perfectly grilled, and crusty, and the whole grain mustard and caramelized onion jam combined with everything to make the perfect bite. unfortunately this also raised our expectations for the other dishes a little too high- fries+trio of dips (2/5): the fries were nothing special, my friend said if you told him they were in-n-out fries he wouldn't have questioned it. the basil aioli was light and refreshing, but lacked flavor. the old bay aioli didn't taste like anything. the only solid dip was the ketchup :/- fried chicken po'boy (3/5): really more of a fried chicken sandwich, as it didn't come on french bread but regular buns. the buns were toasted well and super light and fluffy though! the chicken was fried really well and moist BUT it didn't taste like anything. i dont think the breading was seasoned, there wasn't enough sauce, and the cabbage/jalapenos didn't add any flavor or moistness, so it ended up being kind of dry and tasteless overall. i ended up adding the dips to the sandwich to try to add some moisture and flavor. also, we saw that the sandwiches that were brought out to others sitting near us looked fuller than ours which was somewhat disappointing. - overall this place is super cute and had a lot of potential, but sadly did not deliver on flavor for the majority of their dishes. i might come back to try their other dishes though just because the ambiance and pate were really good.","3.5 stars-

"Cute restaurant in the Castro, close to the intersection of Noe Valley. They serve standard American fare - think burgers on thick buns and trendy appetizers like white bean dip and salads with goat cheese. There's a lovely covered outdoor patio which usually fills up quickly for brunch and dinner. They have a happy hour that ends at 6 PM, I highly recommend getting there at 5 PM and having cocktails and appetizers. Weeknights and weekend mornings fill up pretty quickly. Service is a bit slow, but staff is extremely friendly and it's easy to flag someone down. The food is good all 'round -- for dinner, we have tried everything from the halibut to the pasta to the burgers. The rice pudding with cherries for dessert is a nice happy ending :D","cute restaurant in the castro, close to the intersection of noe valley. they serve standard american fare - think burgers on thick buns and trendy appetizers like white bean dip and salads with goat cheese. there's a lovely covered outdoor patio which usually fills up quickly for brunch and dinner. they have a happy hour that ends at 6 pm, i highly recommend getting there at 5 pm and having cocktails and appetizers. weeknights and weekend mornings fill up pretty quickly. service is a bit slow, but staff is extremely friendly and it's easy to flag someone down. the food is good all 'round -- for dinner, we have tried everything from the halibut to the pasta to the burgers. the rice pudding with cherries for dessert is a nice happy ending :d",cute restaurant in the castro close to the intersection of noe valley they serve standard american fare  think burgers on thick buns and trendy appetizers like white bean dip and salads with goat cheese theres a lovely covered outdoor patio which usually fills up quickly for brunch and dinner they have a happy hour that ends at 6 pm i highly recommend getting there at 5 pm and having cocktails and appetizers weeknights and weekend mornings fill up pretty quickly service is a bit slow but staff is extremely friendly and its easy to flag someone down the food is good all round  for dinner we have tried everything from the halibut to the pasta to the burgers the rice pudding with cherries for dessert is a nice happy ending d,cute restaurant castro close intersection noe valley serve standard american fare think burgers thick buns trendy appetizers like white bean dip salads goat cheese theres lovely covered outdoor patio usually fills quickly brunch dinner happy hour ends 6 pm highly recommend getting 5 pm cocktails appetizers weeknights weekend mornings fill pretty quickly service bit slow staff extremely friendly easy flag someone food good round dinner tried everything halibut pasta burgers rice pudding cherries dessert nice happy ending,cute restaurant castro close intersection noe valley serve standard american fare think burgers thick buns trendy appetizers like white bean dip salads goat cheese theres lovely covered outdoor patio usually fills quickly brunch dinner happy hour ends 6 pm highly recommend getting 5 pm cocktails appetizers weeknights weekend mornings fill pretty quickly service bit slow staff extremely friendly easy flag someone food good round dinner tried everything halibut pasta burgers rice pudding cherries dessert nice happy ending,cute restaurant castro close intersection noe valley serve standard american fare think burger thick bun trendy appetizer like white bean dip salad goat cheese there lovely covered outdoor patio usually fill quickly brunch dinner happy hour end 6 pm highly recommend getting 5 pm cocktail appetizer weeknight weekend morning fill pretty quickly service bit slow staff extremely friendly easy flag someone food good round dinner tried everything halibut pasta burger rice pudding cherry dessert nice happy ending,0.26675,0.5824166666666667

"Seriously great food here. Servers were delightful even with such an insane brunch rush. It's a shame I didn't get my servers name he was so lovely and kind with us!!! Otherwise I would shout him out on here. I ordered the corn pizza as corn and cheese a pretty popular asian food combo and I am usually attuned to the taste of my culture  it did have some latin American flavor twist to it with the sauce which was some sort of aioli. I will say it was a tad bit greasy, but hey its a pizza. Italian and oil goes hand in hand. My other friend got the French toast with fantastic toppings with something alike to a blueberry preservative, some nutty seeds and a MASCARPONE. Will say the MASCARPONE I have tried on other french toasts before were a bit more whipped, light and fluffy. This one was a bit more thick and more of a regular cream cheese consistency. Not mad though, it balanced the flavors very well but my friend wasnt a huge fan. My other friend accompanying me ordered the Loco Moco. I also found it peculiar that there seems to be an Asian cuisine twist on this traditionally Latin dish. I tasted a bit of it and it mightve been the best thing on the table. It had a perfectly season sunny side up egg, a hamburger patty cooked about medium rare, over some rice. there was a bit of dehydrated fried onions as well as fresh cut green onions garnishing the egg, and topped off with a soy GLAZE! not soy sauce... a GLAZE! i need the recipe for this supposed glaze cuz it was amazing. I don't even rlly like red meats that much or eat them on the regular, so it was very shocking to me how the flavors were very balanced. Very cute seating, we sat indoors but there is a very nice patio and a bar too.","seriously great food here. servers were delightful even with such an insane brunch rush. it's a shame i didn't get my

"Came for an early Sunday brunch, easily secured a table for 2 around 11am but the place definitely seems to fill up as time goes by.The inside is real nice, spacious and bright. There is a patio where you can sit with your dog, as well as seats in the front. Inside was fine, although it got pretty loud once more people arrived adjacent to our table.The menu isn't as expensive as other brunch spots, but still has some fun stuff on it. Win! I got the Chilaquiles and a coffee, my vegetarian companion got the Italian eggs with a side of fruit. I didn't see any fancier coffee options, so I would double check with them if that's what you're into.The food was solid - good, but not mind blowing. It hit the spot for a casual brunch. What lacked -the chilaquiles, while tasty, felt a bit one note and could have used some more heat or zest. House made chorizo didn't stand out that much, I guess. The fruit side was a bit worse for wear, although I understand it's not the season for lots of brunch fruit. I am lowkey suspecting my coffee might have been part decaf, or maybe it was watered down? Didn't feel very strong. Maybe will go for some alcohol next time instead.Again, good for casual brunch - I wouldn't bring a foodie with expectations, but great vibes, friendly prices (for SF) and ambience if you're getting brunch to be social.","came for an early sunday brunch, easily secured a table for 2 around 11am but the place definitely seems to fill up as time goes by.the inside is real nice, spacious and bright. there is a patio where you can sit with your dog, as well as seats in the front. inside was fine, although it got pretty loud once more people arrived adjacent to our table.the menu isn't as expensive as other brunch spots, but still has some fun stuff on it. win! i got the chilaquiles and a coffee, my vegetarian companion got the italian eggs with a side of fruit. i didn't see any fancier coffee options, so i would double check with them if that's what you're into.the food was solid - good, but not mind blowing. it hit the spot for a casual brunch. what lacked -the chilaquiles, while tasty, felt a bit one note and could have used some more heat or zest. house made chorizo didn't stand out that much, i guess. the fruit side was a bit worse for wear, although i understand it's not the season for lots of brunch fruit. i am lowkey suspecting my coffee might have been part decaf, or maybe it was watered down?

"Maybe I'm just not a fan of New American food or I'm a snobby San Francisco foodie now. But I feel like the standard for pizza and hamburgers are pretty high in the city.

"A very unremarkable brunch! Not bad, but not great, so a solid 3. The marguerita pizza was hard on the bottom and chewy on top. The chicken and waffles was just fine, the chicken was pretty crispy on the outside. I enjoyed the salty dog cocktail. Nice elderflower flavor comes through and pairs well w/ the gin and grapefruit. The tea for two was bitter, would not reorder. Service was good. There is seating on the front and back patio, and inside in the main dining area.","a very unremarkable brunch! not bad, but not great, so a solid 3. the marguerita pizza was hard on the bottom and chewy on top. the chicken and waffles was just fine, the chicken was pretty crispy on the outside. i enjoyed the salty dog cocktail. nice elderflower flavor comes through and pairs well w/ the gin and grapefruit. the tea for two was bitter, would not reorder. service was good. there is seating on the front and back patio, and inside in the main dining area.",a very unremarkable brunch not bad but not great so a solid 3 the marguerita pizza was hard on the bottom and chewy on top the chicken and waffles was just fine the chicken was pretty crispy on the outside i enjoyed the salty dog cocktail nice elderflower flavor comes through and pairs well w the gin and grapefruit the tea for two was bitter would not reorder service was good there is seating on the front and back patio and inside in the main dining area,unremarkable brunch bad great solid 3 marguerita pizza hard bottom chewy top chicken waffles fine chicken pretty crispy outside enjoyed salty dog cocktail nice elderflower flavor comes pairs well w gin grapefruit tea two bitter would reorder service good seating front back patio inside main dining area,unremarkable brunch bad great solid 3 marguerita pizza hard bottom chewy top chicken waffles fine chicken pretty crispy outside enjoyed salty dog cocktail nice elderflower flavor comes pairs well w gin grapefruit tea two bitter reorder service good seating front back patio inside main dining area,unremarkable brunch bad great solid 3 marguerita pizza hard bottom chewy top chicken waffle fine chicken pretty crispy outside enjoyed salty dog cocktail nice elderflower flavor come pair well w gin grapefruit tea two bitter reorder service good seating front back patio inside main dining area,0.10260416666666668,0.5713541666666666
"Walked in here to get brunch on a Sunday, and ended up waiting for about half an hour, which was decent given the popularity of this place.We ordered a couple cocktails to begin with, and they came out p quick. Taste was a solid 7/10 on both.Next we got the fish tacos, french toast and a dish called the loco moco, which is essentially a beef patty topped with a runny egg.The fish tacos were crunchy, fatty, and made helluva brunch. The french toast tasted super satisfying, but the amount of calories on that plate, my god. The loco moco was a good balance, and the patty was cooked as I had asked for, the egg had a nice mouthfeel, and the rice made it a complete dish.The portion sizes on each was good, and is enough for an adult, unless you go splitsies. The waitstaff was warm and the ambience was very welcoming. Definitely a go-go!10/10 would go back again!","walked in here to get brunch on a sunday, and ended up waiting for about half an hour, which was decent given the popularity of this place.we ordered a couple cocktails to begin with, and they came out p quick. taste was a solid 7/10 on both.next we got the fish tacos, french toast and a dish called the loco moco, which is essentially a beef patty topped with a runny egg.the fish tacos were crunchy, fatty, and made helluva brunch. the french toast tasted super satisfying, but the amount of calories on that plate, my god. the loco moco was a good balance, and the patty was cooked as i had asked for, the egg had a nice mouthfeel, and the rice made it a complete dish.the portion sizes on each was good, and is enough for an adult, unless you go splitsies. the waitstaff was warm and the ambience was very welcoming. definitely a go-go!10/10 would go back again!",walked in here to get brunch on a sunday and ended up waiting for about half an hour which was decent given the popularity of this placewe ordered a couple cocktails to begin with and they came out p quick taste was a solid 710 on bothnext we got the fish tacos french toast and a dish called the loco moco which is essentially a beef patty topped with a runny eggthe fish tacos were crunchy fatty and made helluva brunch the french toast tasted super satisfying but the amount of calories on that plate my god the loco moco was a good balance and the patty was cooked as i had asked for the egg had a nice mouthfeel and the rice made it a complete dishthe portion sizes on each was good and is enough for an adult unless you go splitsies the waitstaff was warm and the ambience was very welcoming definitely a gogo1010 would go back again,walked get brunch sunday ended waiting half hour decent given popularity placewe ordered couple cocktails begin came p quick taste solid 710 bothnext got fish tacos french toast dish called loco moco essentially beef patty topped runny eggthe fish tacos crunchy fatty made helluva brunch french toast tasted super satisfying amount calories plate god loco moco good balance patty cooked asked egg nice mouthfeel rice made complete dishthe portion sizes good enough adult unless go splitsies waitstaff warm ambience welcoming definitely gogo1010 would go back,walked brunch sunday ended waiting half hour decent given popularity placewe ordered couple cocktails begin p quick taste solid 710 bothnext fish tacos french toast dish called loco moco essentially beef patty topped runny eggthe fish tacos crunchy fatty made helluva brunch french toast tasted super satisfying amount calories plate god loco moco good balance patty cooked asked egg nice mouthfeel rice made complete dishthe portion sizes good enough adult unless splitsies waitstaff warm ambience welcoming definitely gogo1010 back,walked brunch sunday ended waiting half hour decent given popularity placewe ordered couple cocktail begin p quick taste solid 710 bothnext fish taco french toast dish called loco moco essentially beef patty topped runny eggthe fish taco crunchy fatty made helluva brunch french toast tasted super satisfying amount calorie plate god loco moco good balance patty cooked asked egg nice mouthfeel rice made complete dishthe portion size good enough adult unless splitsies waitstaff warm ambience welcoming definitely gogo1010 back,0.19824561403508772,0.4368421052631579

"Probably should have made reservations on a Sunday evening, but thankfully, some seats opened up at the bar and they were able to seat us pretty quickly. We had the chicken liver pâté, which was out-of-this-world! That grilled bread was so good all on its own and paired with the pâté, fresh mustard seeds, and jam/jelly on the side just knocked it out of the park. The Starbelly bacon pizza just elevated the experience even further. The bacon with the arugula, jalapenos and that green goddess sauce (OMG) was the perfect blend of savory, bitter, spicy, and tangy. It looks like they change up their menus seasonally, so I'm long overdue for another visit.

"My friend was having his birthday dinner here and there were about 16 of us. They are definitely good at accommodating bigger parties. We had a pleasant experience throughout the dinner. When he made the reservation, they required us to put our order ahead of time and it was a set menu for all of us. The set menu costs $50 per person without drinks included. For starters, we had the chicken liver pate and the crab & burrata dumplings. Then we were served starbelly salad. Pizza margherita fresh spaghetti with starbelly bacon, salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewers, date& toffee cake. I think the set menu, food portion and service along with cocktails were worth the price.","my friend was having his birthday dinner here and there were about 16 of us. they are definitely good at accommodating bigger parties. we had a pleasant experience throughout the dinner. when he made the reservation, they required us to put our order ahead of time and it was a set menu for all of us. the set menu costs $50 per person without drinks included. for starters, we had the chicken liver pate and the crab & burrata dumplings. then we were served starbelly salad. pizza margherita fresh spaghetti with starbelly bacon, salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewers, date& toffee cake. i think the set menu, food portion and service along with cocktails were worth the price.",my friend was having his birthday dinner here and there were about 16 of us they are definitely good at accommodating bigger parties we had a pleasant experience throughout the dinner when he made the reservation they required us to put our order ahead of time and it was a set menu for all of us the set menu costs 50 per person without drinks included for starters we had the chicken liver pate and the crab  burrata dumplings then we were served starbelly salad pizza margherita fresh spaghetti with starbelly bacon salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewers date toffee cake i think the set menu food portion and service along with cocktails were worth the price,friend birthday dinner 16 us definitely good accommodating bigger parties pleasant experience throughout dinner made reservation required us put order ahead time set menu us set menu costs 50 per person without drinks included starters chicken liver pate crab burrata dumplings served starbelly salad pizza margherita fresh spaghetti starbelly bacon salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewers date toffee cake think set menu food portion service along cocktails worth price,friend birthday dinner 16 definitely good accommodating bigger parties pleasant experience throughout dinner made reservation required put order ahead time set menu set menu costs 50 per person without drinks included starters chicken liver pate crab burrata dumplings served starbelly salad pizza margherita fresh spaghetti starbelly bacon salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewers date toffee cake think set menu food portion service along cocktails worth price,friend birthday dinner 16 definitely good accommodating bigger party pleasant experience throughout dinner made reservation required put order ahead time set menu set menu cost 50 per person without drink included starter chicken liver pate crab burrata dumpling served starbelly salad pizza margherita fresh spaghetti starbelly bacon salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewer date toffee cake think set menu food portion service along cocktail worth price,0.23888888888888885,0.6027777777777777

"The ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and the staff were super friendly. I ordered the lavender lemonade and the chicken & waffles for brunch.

"On our weekly date night, we decided to grab some dinner at Starbelly as it's always a great choice when dining in the Castro. Located on one of the busiest intersections, it's super accessible. I love the space! Lots of options for dining - outside seating in the front and the back patio, bar and high top seating, and a proper in-house dining area for tables. There's a climate and seat preference for everyone. The menu is seasonal and packed with locally sourced ingredients. Here's what we got off the winter dinner menu 2022: - Rose of Pinot Noir - Latransa for $48 a bottle- House-made chicken liver pate for $12. It's on a board with bread, sweet onion marmalade, and grain mustard. I love a good charcuterie board with different items; this was great! I also love that they bring more bread upon request- Grilled bavette steak for $30. While it comes with potato puree, we opted to get the french fries instead. The place also included crispy brussels sprouts and garlic porcini butter. So good! Love the flavors and am glad we got the fries! As mentioned, Starbelly is always a great place and option while visiting the Castro.

"The service was very nice. The waiters were friendly. The butternut squash pizza is a 10 out of 10 I would highly recommend. Very flavorful and unique. The crust was thin, but nicely crunchy. The chicken Po boy sandwich was very good. They set a lot of fries. Had some left over but finished it. You have to order the fries separately though. I think it's like two bucks, but it was worth it couldn't hear the waiter though he is very soft. outdoor seating heater was on. Very modern very San Francisco.","the service was very nice. the waiters were friendly. the butternut squash pizza is a 10 out of 10 i would highly recommend. very flavorful and unique. the crust was thin, but nicely crunchy. the chicken po boy sandwich was very good. they set a lot of fries. had some left over but finished it. you have to order the fries separately though. i think it's like two bucks, but it was worth it couldn't hear the waiter though he is very soft. outdoor seating heater was on. very modern very san francisco.",the service was very nice the waiters were friendly the butternut squash pizza is a 10 out of 10 i would highly recommend very flavorful and unique the crust was thin but nicely crunchy the chicken po boy sandwich was very good they set a lot of fries had some left over but finished it you have to order the fries separately though i think its like two bucks but it was worth it couldnt hear the waiter though he is very soft outdoor seating heater was on very modern very san francisco,service nice waiters friendly butternut squash pizza 10 10 would highly recommend flavorful unique crust thin nicely crunchy chicken po boy sandwich good set lot fries left finished order fries separately though think like two bucks worth couldnt hear waiter though soft outdoor seating heater modern san francisco,service nice waiters friendly butternut squash pizza 10 10 highly recommend flavorful unique crust thin nicely crunchy chicken po boy sandwich good set lot fries left finished order fries separately though think like two bucks worth couldnt hear waiter though soft outdoor seating heater modern san francisco,service nice waiter friendly butternut squash pizza 10 10 highly recommend flavorful unique crust thin nicely crunchy chicken po boy sandwich good set lot fry left finished order fry separately though think like two buck worth couldnt hear waiter though soft outdoor seating heater modern san francisco,0.20083333333333334,0.5991666666666667

Looking for a last minute dinner reservation and I was happy to be able to come here. The staff is great and the service is really fast.  We decided to share several small plates and one main entree.  The burrata was good but the bread was too soft.  The pate was really good.  The lamb meatballs were delicious.  The starbelly salad was good but slightly overdressed.  Finished up with the shrimp and andouille sausage and rice with okra.  This was all really good. The okra was cooked nice which isn't always easy to do.  It had a great taste overall and although super buttery it was so good.  Overall it's a nice place and I would go back if I lived here.,looking for a last minute dinner reservation and i was happy to be able to come here. the staff is great and the service is really fast. we decided to share several small plates and one main entree. the burrata was good but the bread was too soft. the pate was really good. the lamb meatballs were delicious. the starbelly salad was good but slightly overdressed. finished up with the shrimp and andouille sausage and rice with okra. this was all really good. the okra was cooked nice which isn't always easy to do. it had a great taste overall and although super buttery it was so good. overall it's a nice place and i would go back if i lived here.,looking for a last minute dinner reservation and i was happy to be able to come here the staff is great and the service is really fast we decided to share several small plates and one main entree the burrata was good but the bread was too soft the pate was really good the lamb meatballs were delicious the starbelly salad was good but slightly overdressed finished up with the shrimp and andouille sausage and rice with okra this was all really good the okra was cooked nice which isnt always easy to do it had a great taste overall and although super buttery it was so good overall its a nice place and i would go back if i lived here,looking last minute dinner reservation happy able come staff great service really fast decided share several small plates one main entree burrata good bread soft pate really good lamb meatballs delicious starbelly salad good slightly overdressed finished shrimp andouille sausage rice okra really good okra cooked nice isnt always easy great taste overall although super buttery good overall nice place would go back lived,looking last minute dinner reservation happy able come staff great service really fast decided share several small plates main entree burrata good bread soft pate really good lamb meatballs delicious starbelly salad good slightly overdressed finished shrimp andouille sausage rice okra really good okra cooked nice isnt always easy great taste overall although super buttery good overall nice place back lived,looking last minute dinner reservation happy able come staff great service really fast decided share several small plate main entree burrata good bread soft pate really good lamb meatball delicious starbelly salad good slightly overdressed finished shrimp andouille sausage rice okra really good okra cooked nice isnt always easy great taste overall although super buttery good overall nice place back lived,0.3923611111111111,0.5225694444444444
"My friends and I went for brunch. We got the chicken po boy with fries, the Italian eggs, and the chilaquiles. I tried a little bit of the three and I thought the best was the Italian eggs. The chilaquiles were good, too, but not something I'd get if I go next time. The chicken po boy was disappointing -- the fried chicken tasted unseasoned and kind of soggy (or wasn't as crispy as it looked like). The vibes were good but the food was OK. As for the service, the staff felt a little all over the place -- which is kind of understandable given it was height brunch time on a weekend.It took a while for us to get someone's attention and felt a little rushed at the end when we wanted to stay longer but was told the table had to be used for a different reservation.","my friends and i went for brunch. we got the chicken po boy with fries, the italian eggs, and the chilaquiles. i tried a little bit of the three and i thought the best was the italian eggs. the chilaquiles were good, too, but not something i'd get if i go next time. the chicken po boy was disappointing -- the fried chicken tasted unseasoned and kind of soggy (or wasn't as crispy as it looked like). the vibes were good but the food was ok. as for the service, the staff felt a little all over the place -- which is kind of understandable given it was height brunch time on a weekend.it took a while for us to get someone's attention and felt a little rushed at the end when we wanted to stay longer but was told the table had to be used for a different reservation.",my friends and i went for brunch we got the chicken po boy with fries the italian eggs and the chilaquiles i tried a little bit of the three and i thought the best was the italian eggs the chilaquiles were good too but not something id get if i go next time the chicken po boy was disappointing  the fried chicken tasted unseasoned and kind of soggy or wasnt as crispy as it looked like the vibes were good but the food was ok as for the service the staff felt a little all over the place  which is kind of understandable given it was height brunch time on a weekendit took a while for us to get someones attention and felt a little rushed at the end when we wanted to stay longer but was told the table had to be used for a different reservation,friends went brunch got chicken po boy fries italian eggs chilaquiles tried little bit three thought best italian eggs chilaquiles good something id get go next time chicken po boy disappointing fried chicken tasted unseasoned kind soggy wasnt crispy looked like vibes good food ok service staff felt little place kind understandable given height brunch time weekendit took us get someones attention felt little rushed end wanted stay longer told table used different reservation,friends went brunch chicken po boy fries italian eggs chilaquiles tried little bit three thought best italian eggs chilaquiles good something id next time chicken po boy disappointing fried chicken tasted unseasoned kind soggy wasnt crispy looked like vibes good food ok service staff felt little place kind understandable given height brunch time weekendit took someones attention felt little rushed end wanted stay longer told table used different reservation,friend went brunch chicken po boy fry italian egg chilaquiles tried little bit three thought best italian egg chilaquiles good something id next time chicken po boy disappointing fried chicken tasted unseasoned kind soggy wasnt crispy looked like vibe good food ok service staff felt little place kind understandable given height brunch time weekendit took someone attention felt little rushed end wanted stay longer told table used different reservation,0.06691176470588235,0.5558823529411765

"I just came here about two weekends ago for Saturday Brunch. I have gone here prior for dinner with friends. But, it actually was a 4 star experience. I think the reason for the 5 is because of the service.The brunch drinks are delicious. I had a strawberry drink that was pretty strong and we all ordered them. As far as food this is what we indulged:- Pizza with Bacon and sausage- Chorizo Chilaquiles-- these were okay nothing to die for, I would probably get the pizza for myself next time.- My friend had the 2 farmhouse eggs, potatoes and a breakfast sausage.Overall it was a good experience because of their outside area and the service was spectacular. :)","i just came here about two weekends ago for saturday brunch. i have gone here prior for dinner with friends. but, it actually was a 4 star experience. i think the reason for the 5 is because of the service.the brunch drinks are delicious. i had a strawberry drink that was pretty strong and we all ordered them. as far as food this is what we indulged:- pizza with bacon and sausage- chorizo chilaquiles-- these were okay nothing to die for, i would probably get the pizza for myself next time.- my friend had the 2 farmhouse eggs, potatoes and a breakfast sausage.overall it was a good experience because of their outside area and the service was spectacular. :)",i just came here about two weekends ago for saturday brunch i have gone here prior for dinner with friends but it actually was a 4 star experience i think the reason for the 5 is because of the servicethe brunch drinks are delicious i had a strawberry drink that was pretty strong and we all ordered them as far as food this is what we indulged pizza with bacon and sausage chorizo chilaquiles these were okay nothing to die for i would probably get the pizza for myself next time my friend had the 2 farmhouse eggs potatoes and a breakfast sausageoverall it was a good experience because of their outside area and the service was spectacular ,came two weekends ago saturday brunch gone prior dinner friends actually 4 star experience think reason 5 servicethe brunch drinks delicious strawberry drink pretty strong ordered far food indulged pizza bacon sausage chorizo chilaquiles okay nothing die would probably get pizza next time friend 2 farmhouse eggs potatoes breakfast sausageoverall good experience outside area service spectacular,two weekends ago saturday brunch gone prior dinner friends actually 4 star experience think reason 5 servicethe brunch drinks delicious strawberry drink pretty strong ordered far food indulged pizza bacon sausage chorizo chilaquiles okay nothing die probably pizza next time friend 2 farmhouse eggs potatoes breakfast sausageoverall good experience outside area service spectacular,two weekend ago saturday brunch gone prior dinner friend actually 4 star experience think reason 5 servicethe brunch drink delicious strawberry drink pretty strong ordered far food indulged pizza bacon sausage chorizo chilaquiles okay nothing die probably pizza next time friend 2 farmhouse egg potato breakfast sausageoverall good experience outside area service spectacular,0.32575757575757575,0.5348484848484849
"Starbelly is a casual restaurant in the Castro. We came here for brunch on a weekend and it was surprisingly not packed and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Do note that they take reservations by phone if you have a larger party.The brunch menu has classic American brunch dishes with some more unique options. The Fried Chicken & Waffles has to be my favorite. It comes with two large portions of flavorful and crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy buttermilk waffles. It's flavorful and filling. The farmhouse eggs with potatoes and bacon is also a good option. Their potatoes and bacon are very crispy, which I enjoyed.The venue was cute and spacious. The service could have been a bit better, however. We received the incorrect order and it took a bit for it to be corrected. The food was then sent to another table rather than being discarded. The check also took a while to receive.","starbelly is a casual restaurant in the castro. we came here for brunch on a weekend and it was surprisingly not packed and we didn't have to wait to be seated. do note that they take reservations by phone if you have a larger party.the brunch menu has classic american brunch dishes with some more unique options. the fried chicken & waffles has to be my favorite. it comes with two large portions of flavorful and crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy buttermilk waffles. it's flavorful and filling. the farmhouse eggs with potatoes and bacon is also a good option. their potatoes and bacon are very crispy, which i enjoyed.the venue was cute and spacious. the service could have been a bit better, however. we received the incorrect order and it took a bit for it to be corrected. the food was then sent to another table rather than being discarded. the check also took a while to receive.",starbelly is a casual restaurant in the castro we came here for brunch on a weekend and it was surprisingly not packed and we didnt have to wait to be seated do note that they take reservations by phone if you have a larger partythe brunch menu has classic american brunch dishes with some more unique options the fried chicken  waffles has to be my favorite it comes with two large portions of flavorful and crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy buttermilk waffles its flavorful and filling the farmhouse eggs with potatoes and bacon is also a good option their potatoes and bacon are very crispy which i enjoyedthe venue was cute and spacious the service could have been a bit better however we received the incorrect order and it took a bit for it to be corrected the food was then sent to another table rather than being discarded the check also took a while to receive,starbelly casual restaurant castro came brunch weekend surprisingly packed didnt wait seated note take reservations phone larger partythe brunch menu classic american brunch dishes unique options fried chicken waffles favorite comes two large portions flavorful crispy fried chicken sandwiched fluffy buttermilk waffles flavorful filling farmhouse eggs potatoes bacon also good option potatoes bacon crispy enjoyedthe venue cute spacious service could bit better however received incorrect order took bit corrected food sent another table rather discarded check also took receive,starbelly casual restaurant castro brunch weekend surprisingly packed didnt wait seated note take reservations phone larger partythe brunch menu classic american brunch dishes unique options fried chicken waffles favorite comes two large portions flavorful crispy fried chicken sandwiched fluffy buttermilk waffles flavorful filling farmhouse eggs potatoes bacon also good option potatoes bacon crispy enjoyedthe venue cute spacious service could bit better however received incorrect order took bit corrected food sent another table rather discarded check also took receive,starbelly casual restaurant castro brunch weekend surprisingly packed didnt wait seated note take reservation phone larger partythe brunch menu classic american brunch dish unique option fried chicken waffle favorite come two large portion flavorful crispy fried chicken sandwiched fluffy buttermilk waffle flavorful filling farmhouse egg potato bacon also good option potato bacon crispy enjoyedthe venue cute spacious service could bit better however received incorrect order took bit corrected food sent another table rather discarded check also took receive,0.1254251700680272,0.6329931972789116

"This place is pure magic..how the tiny kitchen and small staff are able to accommodate such a huge space is beyond me. The chill severs and relaxed vibe make this a neighborhood go to. The dishes are simple and oh so comforting. The menu changes seasonally but there are staples that you can always count on being there...the fresh spaghetti, pizzas and burgers are popular favorites, and every iteration of the decadent dumplings are a must try. This is one of the few places you can go in the winter and sit outside and really be cozy. The wide selection of tables/ atmospheres means there's a place that everyone will love. The back patio is either fully or partially covered, giving you the experience of being outside but with the warmth of huge heat lamps. I've found it's actually sometimes warmer there in the winter months than inside even. It's also the most happening section in the whole place. I've heard you can rent it out for private events and I can't wait to plan a party there. The parklet tables on the street are like your own private oasis..warm to the point where you'll shed your jacket even on the coldest nights.

"Starbelly is pretty cool! We began our meal with cocktails. My gf ordered the Strawberry Alarm Clock and I asked the waiter if they could make me something with Scotch, and they brought me Penicillin (the cocktail, not the antibiotic). Both were on point - and I was especially pleased with the Penicillin because this was not on the menu (but the waiter was correct that they had great bartenders ay Starbelly).For appetizers, we shared garlic fries and sweet potato dumplings. Also on point. Fries were hot and sufficiently garlicky, and unlike what appears to be popular at most restaurants, these were thicker fries (almost steak fries) that nonetheless maintained a slight crisp (without being crunchy) - anyway, they were above average. The dumplings were magic, savory and smooth with a touch of sweetness and great mouthfeel.I ordered a steak and my gf ordered a burger. My steak was good, if a bit more cooked than I wanted (I asked for medium-rare, and it was on the well done side of medium). The mashed potatoes that came with it were smooth as silk and tasted wonderful and the brussels made for an excellent sidekick. The burger was solid. As for non-edibles, the wait staff was lovely and the space is great. We sat inside, which had light and tasteful holiday decorations, but the patio looked cool, too. We hope to come back for brunch sometime.","starbelly is pretty cool! we began our meal with cocktails. my gf ordered the strawberry alarm clock and i asked the waiter if they could make me something with scotch, and they brought me penicillin (the cocktail, not the antibiotic). both were on point -

"Met a friend here, her 1st time.Thankfully we went early and missed the the Mommy Daddy Baby crowd and the later louder crowd.So we pretty much had the place to ourselves.Service was great and very attentive, sadly, I don't know the fellas' name, my friend has the receipt.We started with the Chicken Liver Pate which was outstanding and a very generous portion and plenty of toast points to go with. Though we had to ask for my onion Chutney, not enough for the whole serving - $14.00Next up my favorite the Starbelly Bacon Jalapeno pizza w/Green Goddess dressing - $18 = 8 large slices, plenty. This one was a bit of a fail this time (1st time, as I've had it many times). Too heavily garnished with arugula but the bigger issue was it was way too heavy on the tomato sauce, which lended to a very soggy wet pizza in the middle and 1st bite, everything slid right off. Plus, it was really skimpy on the bacon. Graciously, after mentioning this to our server, they made us a brand new pizza, minimal sauce, more or the right amount of bacon and cooked more ""well done"". I shall remember this next time I have a pizza.I will return but did want to mention this about the pizza. If you too experience this, ask them to re-do.","met a friend here, her 1st time.thankfully we went early and missed the the mommy daddy baby crowd and the later louder crowd.so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.service was great and very attentive, sadly, i don't know the fellas' name, my friend has the receipt.we started with the chicken liver pate which was outstanding and a very generous portion and plenty of toast points to go with. though we had to ask for my onion chutney, not enough for the whole serving - $14.00next up my favorite the starbelly bacon jalapeno pizza w/green goddess dressing - $18 = 8 large slices, plenty. this one was a bit of a fail this time (1st time, as i've had it many times). too heavily garnished with arugula but the bigger issue was it was way too heavy on the tomato sauce, which lended to a very soggy wet pizza in the middle and 1st bite, everything slid right off. plus, it was really skimpy on the bacon. graciously, after mentioning this to our server, they made us a brand new pizza, minimal sauce, more or the right amount of bacon and cooked more ""well done"". i shall remember this next time i have a pizza.i will return but did want to mention this about the pizza. if you too experience this, ask them to re-do.",met a friend here her 1st timethankfully we went early and missed the the mommy daddy baby crowd and the later louder crowdso we pretty much had the place to ourselvesservice was great and very attentive sadly i dont know the fellas name my friend has the receiptwe started with the chicken liver pate which was outstanding and a very generous portion and plenty of toast points to go with though we had to ask for my onion chutney not enough for the whole serving  1400next up my favorite the starbelly bacon jalapeno pizza wgreen goddess dressing  18  8 large slices plenty this one was a bit of a fail this time 1st time as ive had it many times too heavily garnished with arugula but the bigger issue was it was way too heavy on the tomato sauce which lended to a very soggy wet pizza in the middle and 1st bite everything slid right off plus it was really skimpy on the bacon graciously after mentioning this to our server they made us a brand new pizza minimal sauce more or the right amount of bacon and cooked more well done i shall remember this next time i have a pizzai will return but did want to mention this about the pizza if you too experience this ask them to redo,met friend 1st timethankfully went early missed mommy daddy baby crowd later louder crowdso pretty much place ourselvesservice great attentive sadly dont know fellas name friend receiptwe started chicken liver pate outstanding generous portion plenty toast points go though ask onion chutney enough whole serving 1400next favorite starbelly bacon jalapeno pizza wgreen goddess dressing 18 8 large slices plenty one bit fail time 1st time ive many times heavily garnished arugula bigger issue way heavy tomato sauce lended soggy wet pizza middle 1st bite everything slid right plus really skimpy bacon graciously mentioning server made us brand new pizza minimal sauce right amount bacon cooked well done shall remember next time pizzai return want mention pizza experience ask redo,met friend 1st timethankfully went early missed mommy daddy baby crowd later louder crowdso pretty much place ourselvesservice great attentive sadly dont know fellas name friend receiptwe started chicken liver pate outstanding generous portion plenty toast points though ask onion chutney enough whole serving 1400next favorite starbelly bacon jalapeno pizza wgreen goddess dressing 18 8 large slices plenty bit fail time 1st time ive many times heavily garnished arugula bigger issue way heavy tomato sauce lended soggy wet pizza middle 1st bite everything slid right plus really skimpy bacon graciously mentioning server made brand new pizza minimal sauce right amount bacon cooked well done shall remember next time pizzai return want mention pizza experience ask redo,met friend 1st timethankfully went early missed mommy daddy baby crowd later louder crowdso pretty much place ourselvesservice great attentive sadly dont know fella name friend receiptwe started chicken liver pate outstanding generous portion plenty toast point though ask onion chutney enough whole serving 1400next favorite starbelly bacon jalapeno pizza wgreen goddess dressing 18 8 large slice plenty bit fail time 1st time ive many time heavily garnished arugula bigger issue way heavy tomato sauce lended soggy wet pizza middle 1st bite everything slid right plus really skimpy bacon graciously mentioning server made brand new pizza minimal sauce right amount bacon cooked well done shall remember next time pizzai return want mention pizza experience ask redo,0.09123376623376621,0.5126748251748252
"One of my all time ""go to"" places in the city for consistently good food, decent service and the prices won't break your bank.LOVE the patio space, though it can get rather loud.So far I've introduced 5 friends to Starbelly, and now it's on their list.My fave food there is the Pizza. Especially the bacon, jalapeño, arugula & green goddess dressing pizza. It is pretty spicy though, just warning all.I tried the mixed chicories & arugula, pear, dates, smoked almonds  & blue cheese salad. Nice presentation, ample portion. Could have used a wee bit more dressing.I also tried the Bibb lettuce, green goddess dressing, grilled chicken, bacon & cherry tomatoes salad. First time it was FAB. Second time, I don't know, the ingredients were pretty skimpy (IMP)!I did not find the non alcoholic beverages to be that tasty. The description's sounded better than they really were.

"I really really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it didn't hit the spot, or maybe it was an off night? My friends and I got the fries, potato dumplings, Brussels sprouts, chorizo pizza; and the spaghetti. The fries came unseasoned and also a little cold, and the sauces were nothing too special.

"This has become one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  Besides the food being excellent - we love the white bean purée, as well as the pasta appetizers....   and steak for main entree - the service is great.  The service here is top notch.  It hasn't mattered who is our server, this is an extremely well run restaurant.  Orders go in and food comes out pretty quickly.  Someone is always checking on your table and proactively refilling water, etc.  Its clearly a well orchestrated team effort rather than one person doing everything for your table, and it works well. Last time we went we tried out the back patio.  It was much quieter than the main restaurant and still had decent airflow but with heat lamps.   Very pleasant.  We got there at 530 pm and there was hardly anyone there.   By the time we left, it was about half full but I know this location gets much busier around 7.","this has become one of our favorite restaurants in san francisco. besides the food being excellent - we love the white bean purée, as well as the pasta appetizers.... and steak for main entree - the service is great. the service here is top notch. it hasn't mattered who is our server, this is an extremely well run restaurant. orders go in and food comes out pretty quickly. someone is always checking on your table and proactively refilling water, etc. its clearly a well orchestrated team effort rather than one person doing everything for your table, and it works well. last time we went we tried out the back patio. it was much quieter than the main restaurant and still had decent airflow but with heat lamps. very pleasant. we got there at 530 pm and there was hardly anyone there. by the time we left, it was about half full but i know this location gets much busier around 7.",this has become one of our favorite restaurants in san francisco besides the food being excellent  we love the white bean purée as well as the pasta appetizers and steak for main entree  the service is great the service here is top notch it hasnt mattered who is our server this is an extremely well run restaurant orders go in and food comes out pretty quickly someone is always checking on your table and proactively refilling water etc its clearly a well orchestrated team effort rather than one person doing everything for your table and it works well last time we went we tried out the back patio it was much quieter than the main restaurant and still had decent airflow but with heat lamps very pleasant we got there at 530 pm and there was hardly anyone there by the time we left it was about half full but i know this location gets much busier around 7,become one favorite restaurants san francisco besides food excellent love white bean purée well pasta appetizers steak main entree service great service top notch hasnt mattered server extremely well run restaurant orders go food comes pretty quickly someone always checking table proactively refilling water etc clearly well orchestrated team effort rather one person everything table works well last time went tried back patio much quieter main restaurant still decent airflow heat lamps pleasant got 530 pm hardly anyone time left half full know location gets much busier around 7,become favorite restaurants san francisco besides food excellent love white bean purée well pasta appetizers steak main entree service great service top notch hasnt mattered server extremely well run restaurant orders food comes pretty quickly someone always checking table proactively refilling water etc clearly well orchestrated team effort rather person everything table works well last time went tried back patio much quieter main restaurant still decent airflow heat lamps pleasant 530 pm hardly anyone time left half full know location gets much busier around 7,become favorite restaurant san francisco besides food excellent love white bean purée well pasta appetizer steak main entree service great service top notch hasnt mattered server extremely well run restaurant order food come pretty quickly someone always checking table proactively refilling water etc clearly well orchestrated team effort rather person everything table work well last time went tried back patio much quieter main restaurant still decent airflow heat lamp pleasant 530 pm hardly anyone time left half full know location get much busier around 7,0.24469696969696972,0.4890151515151514
"First time at Starbelly was an experience that I could only describe as delightful. Atmosphere was lovely on the back patio with music at a perfect volume so conversations wouldn't get lost, and it was very well shaded. I had the white sangria and the fried chicken po'boy off the summer brunch menu. The sandwich and fries were divine, but unfortunately, the sangria was nothing to phone home about. It could've used some more cut fruit and a fuller flavor palate. But overall, everything was very good! Service was great and we were there for a friend's birthday so they gave her a dessert with a candle...so cute. I'd highly recommend Starbelly if you're looking for a chill brunch spot!","first time at starbelly was an experience that i could only describe as delightful. atmosphere was lovely on the back patio with music at a perfect volume so conversations wouldn't get lost, and it was very well shaded. i had the white sangria and the fried chicken po'boy off the summer brunch menu. the sandwich and fries were divine, but unfortunately, the sangria was nothing to phone home about. it could've used some more cut fruit and a fuller flavor palate. but overall, everything was very good! service was great and we were there for a friend's birthday so they gave her a dessert with a candle...so cute. i'd highly recommend starbelly if you're looking for a chill brunch spot!",first time at starbelly was an experience that i could only describe as delightful atmosphere was lovely on the back patio with music at a perfect volume so conversations wouldnt get lost and it was very well shaded i had the white sangria and the fried chicken poboy off the summer brunch menu the sandwich and fries were divine but unfortunately the sangria was nothing to phone home about it couldve used some more cut fruit and a fuller flavor palate but overall everything was very good service was great and we were there for a friends birthday so they gave her a dessert with a candleso cute id highly recommend starbelly if youre looking for a chill brunch spot,first time starbelly experience could describe delightful atmosphere lovely back patio music perfect volume conversations wouldnt get lost well shaded white sangria fried chicken poboy summer brunch menu sandwich fries divine unfortunately sangria nothing phone home couldve used cut fruit fuller flavor palate overall everything good service great friends birthday gave dessert candleso cute id highly recommend starbelly youre looking chill brunch spot,first time starbelly experience could describe delightful atmosphere lovely back patio music perfect volume conversations wouldnt lost well shaded white sangria fried chicken poboy summer brunch menu sandwich fries divine unfortunately sangria nothing phone home couldve used cut fruit fuller flavor palate overall everything good service great friends birthday gave dessert candleso cute id highly recommend starbelly youre looking chill brunch spot,first time starbelly experience could describe delightful atmosphere lovely back patio music perfect volume conversation wouldnt lost well shaded white sangria fried chicken poboy summer brunch menu sandwich fry divine unfortunately sangria nothing phone home couldve used cut fruit fuller flavor palate overall everything good service great friend birthday gave dessert candleso cute id highly recommend starbelly youre looking chill brunch spot,0.29307692307692307,0.6094871794871795

"This small, and relaxed atmosphere restaurant is presented on a bustling 4 corner section in the Mission district.  You will notice wine bottles crisscrossed in the windows as you walk up, which was a marker for me, and super cool.  The service is top notch.  We were greeted, and received caring service throughout the meal by thoughtful staff.  And be prepared to be presented a small double page menu that packs a great selection of delicious food, and drink options.  Seriously, everything was amazing, and we are going back today!  You are given the choice of bubbly or still water, had to go with the complimentary bubbly water, because bubbles.  We started with the bean puree dish, and the marinated olives which had a delicate flavor of star anise which was surprisingly good. The puree bean dish had alot of flavor between the white bean puree, and the slightly pickled tasting veggies.  I want to go back for that dish alone.  I ordered a salty dog, and it tasted fresh like pressed grapefruit.  The best salty dog I have ever had hands down.  My husband ordered the Margherita pizza with vegan cheese, and ate the entire pizza but let me have a few bites of a slice.  It was a light, thin crust, and very fresh tasting ingredients.  Not the out of a tin can tasting sauce you are typically presented with.  I had the house made bangers, and mash.  That is the best bangers I have had outside of Europe, and I am already craving this dish again.  I ordered the toffee cake to go.  It comes with heavy cream, and candied figs.  I enjoyed it back at the hotel with a brandy sitting in front of the fireplace.  A perfecf dessert to end a perfect dinner.  If your in the area,  do yourself a favor and stop in for a memorable evening.","this small, and relaxed atmosphere

"Came here for a team dinner that was very well organized! We were able to customize a set menu ahead of time and the food came out at a nice pace.FOOD- Pizza margherita: simple and yummy- House cut fries with three dips: particularly tasty because we were so hungry lol. My coworkers and I couldn't figure out what the green dip was but it was yummy- Fresh spaghetti: simple and tasty! Spaghetti was cooked to perfect al-dente texture- Seared Ahi tuna: Loved the crispy broccoli di ciccio. The ahi tuna itself was a bit overcooked which was a bit disappointing- Salted caramel pot de creme: surprisingly very tasty given that I don't like caramel. The cornmeal-rosemary cookies were a huge hit across the team-  Chocolate toffee cake with dates and mascarpone: also very delicious!DRINKSOur team had a good selection of wine. We also ordered a variety of cocktails which all looked pretty. I tried the Salty Dog which had all the flavors I like and was perfect for me.Overall, good venue for a team event.

"The menu is so bizarre!! Unless you're having the burger or a pizza (and this is honestly not the place to get pizza given the incredible options around the city), options are weirdly limited--esp for me bc I don't eat pork (my ONLY restriction). I've been numerous times over the years because friends wanted to go, its before an event at the Castro theater, etc, and every time I'm dumbfounded by the menu. That's my experience but please look up the menu and check it out for yourself to see if it works for you.

The interior was cute and they have outdoor dining in the front and in the back with heat lamps if you're concerned about COVID like me. But back to the food and drinks.

"I ordered the fish tacos and you can add on fries or a salad for $2 more. In general, the food was very well priced considering there were only two tacos. In SF, you should always expect your brunch to be at least $25 including tax and tip. My meal with the fries add-on was around $19 including tax and tip.

"What's the place to go? Starbelly! Until tonight. My partner and I have a reservation for 9:45pm. Due to a street closure caused by a motorcycle and car accident, we are forced to take a minor detour. We park, walk to Starbelly to get our usual menu items and drinks. We get to the entrance and the host says they're closed. We both say we have a 9:45 reservation (see image one). One very unfriendly male at the bar gives us attitude and says, ""it's 9:53, the kitchen is closed"". We tell him we have a 9:45 reservation, how is the kitchen closed? There's even a 10:00pm reservation available (see image two). Doesn't make sense. They just won't sit us and the unfriendly customer service was just unacceptable and didn't expect it from Starbelly staff. Every time I'm here, it's the best customer service but tonight, this one individual was very dismissive and rude. I understand it's the end of your shift and you want to go home (more like go out for this one person) but treat your patrons with respect and honor their reservation. If the kitchen closes at a certain time, the system should reflect that.

"My friends and I stopped by for dinner last night to celebrate my friend's promotion at work. We made reservations for 6 people one week in advance.  Smart idea because this place was packed yesterday! I'm talking about indoor and outdoor dining. Yes, they did follow social distancing protocols with the tables. We ordered spaghetti, Po'Boy fried chicken sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and several cocktails. The staff was attentive even though they had a lot of tables to attend to. Meals arrived promptly. Menu quite limited, but the prices are reasonable considering this is SF. We all seemed to enjoy our food. No complaints. It is a little cramped, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have a phobia of small enclosed places. Parking is limited outside since there are so many popular restaurants around the area. You might have to circle around several times to find a spot.","my friends and i stopped by for dinner last night to celebrate my friend's promotion at work. we made reservations for 6 people one week in advance. smart idea because this place was packed yesterday! i'm talking about indoor and outdoor dining. yes, they did follow social distancing protocols with the tables. we ordered spaghetti, po'boy fried chicken sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and several cocktails. the staff was attentive even though they had a lot of tables to attend to. meals arrived promptly. menu quite limited, but the prices are reasonable considering this is sf. we all seemed to enjoy our food. no complaints. it is a little cramped, so i wouldn't recommend it if you have a phobia of small enclosed places. parking is limited outside since there are so many popular restaurants around the area. you might have to circle around several times to find a spot.",my friends and i stopped by for dinner last night to celebrate my friends promotion at work we made reservations for 6 people one week in advance smart idea because this place was packed yesterday im talking about indoor and outdoor dining yes they did follow social distancing protocols with the tables we ordered spaghetti poboy fried chicken sandwiches burgers pizza and several cocktails the staff was attentive even though they had a lot of tables to attend to meals arrived promptly menu quite limited but the prices are reasonable considering this is sf we all seemed to enjoy our food no complaints it is a little cramped so i wouldnt recommend it if you have a phobia of small enclosed places parking is limited outside since there are so many popular restaurants around the area you might have to circle around several times to find a spot,friends stopped dinner last night celebrate friends promotion work made reservations 6 people one week advance smart idea place packed yesterday im talking indoor outdoor dining yes follow social distancing protocols tables ordered spaghetti poboy fried chicken sandwiches burgers pizza several cocktails staff attentive even though lot tables attend meals arrived promptly menu quite limited prices reasonable considering sf seemed enjoy food complaints little cramped wouldnt recommend phobia small enclosed places parking limited outside since many popular restaurants around area might circle around several times find spot,friends stopped dinner last night celebrate friends promotion work made reservations 6 people week advance smart idea place packed yesterday talking indoor outdoor dining yes follow social distancing protocols tables ordered spaghetti poboy fried chicken sandwiches burgers pizza several cocktails staff attentive even though lot tables attend meals arrived promptly menu quite limited prices reasonable considering sf seemed enjoy food complaints little cramped wouldnt recommend phobia small enclosed places parking limited outside since many popular restaurants around area might circle around several times find spot,friend stopped dinner last night celebrate friend promotion work made reservation 6 people week advance smart idea place packed yesterday talking indoor outdoor dining yes follow social distancing protocol table ordered spaghetti poboy fried chicken sandwich burger pizza several cocktail staff attentive even though lot table attend meal arrived promptly menu quite limited price reasonable considering sf seemed enjoy food complaint little cramped wouldnt recommend phobia small enclosed place parking limited outside since many popular restaurant around area might circle around several time find spot,0.051015406162464985,0.38599439775910366

"We went here for lunch on SF restaurant week. It was quite lovely. We started with the fries served with three dips. Fries were hot and crispy, but only one of the dips was anything to write home about (one was ketchup). From the prix fixe menu, I had the pate with fig jam and mustard which was very good- especially the fig jam. We both choose the Mediterranean plate as our entree. We liked it very much, but thought it could be spiced a little more heavily. Unfortunately, they brought us our entrees when were just about halfway through our appetizers- making our small tabletop crowded & uncomfortable. We also felt a bit rushed. The star of the show were the drinks and dessert! We both loved the basil cucumber limeade and the coffee was perfect! For dessert, we had the date & toffee cake, which was divine! Such a marvelous combination. The cake was not too sweet and had many layers of flavor while still a bit of a rustic type of dessert. The dates & mascarpone were such a scrumptious compliment! The rich, dark coffee was a satisfying pairing with the dessert. Covid practices were on point. Service very good. Price was reasonable. Super diverse staff & patrons (queer & POC friendly). Accessible. We ate inside and we were very far away from other tables. It felt very safe. Starbelly requires that patrons have their mask on whenever they are not eating/drinking. Outside patio and parklet also looked very inviting so will have to try that next!","we went here for lunch on sf restaurant week. it was quite lovely. we started with the fries served with three dips. fries were hot and crispy, but only one of the dips was anything to write home about (one was ketchup). from the prix fixe menu, i had the pate with fig jam and mustard which was very good- especially the fig jam. we both choose the mediterranean plate as our entree. we liked it very much, but thought it could be spiced a little more heavily. unfortunately, they brought us our entrees when were just about halfway through our appetizers- making our small tabletop crowded & uncomfortable. we also felt a bit rushed. the star of the show were the drinks and dessert!

"I ordered delivery from this place last night and it was really great!The chicken liver pâté delivers super well--the bread was soft, and the chicken pate was flavorful and creamy.I got the starbelly bacon pizza and added on prosciutto and farm eggs. This was by far the best thing I ordered. The prosciutto was legit prosciutto and I like that they didn't cook it with the pizza but added it on after. The eggs were gooey on the inside but not undercooked. The arugula added the perfect amount of bitter kick, and the tomato sauce they used was incredible.The pumpkin dumplings I did not enjoy as much as the other two dishes, unfortunately.

"Starbelly is a great spot for comfy brunch food or for their amazing restaurant week deals! I initially came to Starbelly after I saw that their restaurant week lunch was $15 for a 3 course meal consisting of: chicken liver pate, a fried chicken po boy and a salted caramel pot de creme for dessert. The service and the dishes themselves were absolutely delicious, the best of the three definitely being the chicken liver pate which was buttery, and rich with a hint of sweetness. It paired very well with the jam that was served along side the pate. The fried chicken was quite good as well, but it was not as scrumptious as the chicken liver pate, and there are far better places to try fried chicken sandwiches at (such as World Famous HotBoys in Oakland) which outshine this sandwich. Nonetheless, it was a solid sandwich and was very filling!The dessert was also tasty but nothing exciting and new, simply tasting like caramel custard. The second time I came for Starbelly's brunch which is far more fabulous than the restaurant week courses - albeit pricier. My sister and I got the:- French Toast (4.5/5): The french toast came with two thick slices, coated in a strawberry conserve, mascarpone, and pistachios. Although both toast slices were fried they were not too oily and perfectly balanced. The only thing that was missing was a side of maple syrup to dip the pieces of the toast that were not covered in fruit conserve into. - Mimosas: (5/5): The mimosas here are fabulous with the perfect amount of sweetness in the Orange Juice to contrast the strong champagne.- Chorizo pizza: (4/5): The chorizo pizza was great with eggs, large chorizo chunks, cilantro and fresh tomato sauce, however the crust was a tad doughy and the cheese was not as melted as I prefer on oven roasted pizzas. The eggs, however and the chorizo were delicious elements!Be sure to stop by Starbelly the next time you are in the Castro!","starbelly is a great spot for comfy brunch food or for their amazing

"Stumbled upon Starbelly since the bar we planned on going to was closed and this was one of the most reviewed places in the area. We came on a Friday night around 8pm without a reservation, but managed to be seated after about 20 minutes (shoutout to the party that didn't show up for their reservation). The back patio was cozy and thankfully enclosed from the elements because a bitch gets cold!Can't speak much to the food since we just wanted to have drinks, but we decided on the crispy Brussels sprouts since we love us some Brussels sprouts. They sounded real good on the menu and our server even gassed them up, but we weren't fans at all and definitely had better at other places. The crisp was mostly on the outside leaves, so it was mostly soft, reminiscent of steamed/boiled Brussels sprouts your mama made you eat as a kid. The balsamic flavor wasn't as intense as I would've liked, but the bacon was a nice touch. The cocktails, however, were good and worth coming back for. I had the Strawberry Alarm Clock (house-infused strawberry vodka, aperol, lemon) and the friend had the Salty Dog (tequila instead of gin, elderflower, fresh grapefruit). I don't do vodka like that, but the strawberry infusion took off the edge and made for a refreshing drink.On the way out, our server asked us how everything was, but we didn't have the heart to tell her that them Brussels sprouts were not it because sis was real proud of them. I'll have to come back and try the other food on the menu, if not for the drinks!","stumbled upon starbelly since the bar we planned on going to was closed and this was one of the most reviewed places

"What a wonderful, cozy place for date night during COVID! Went in on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy (I imagine they must get packed on Friday/Sat night). They have outdoor dining outside of their restaurant but highly recommend you try booking a table on their outdoor back patio - super cute and more sheltered from the wind/cold. Ambience - 5 stars Food - 4 stars. The pasta was light and delicious, the smoked mozz pizza we got was a little too heavy for us. The chicken pate is to die for BUT don't gorge yourself like I did or you'll have some pretty bad stomach cramps lol.Drinks - 4.5 stars. The sangria is meh, but their cocktails are great! Definitely go for those over the sangria.","what a wonderful, cozy place for date night during covid! went in on a sunday night and it wasn't too busy (i imagine they must get packed on friday/sat night). they have outdoor dining outside of their restaurant but highly recommend you try booking a table on their outdoor back patio - super cute and more sheltered from the wind/cold. ambience - 5 stars food - 4 stars. the pasta was light and delicious, the smoked mozz pizza we got was a little too heavy for us. the chicken pate is to die for but don't gorge yourself like i did or you'll have some pretty bad stomach cramps lol.drinks - 4.5 stars. the sangria is meh, but their cocktails are great! definitely go for those over the sangria.",what a wonderful cozy place for date night during covid went in on a sunday night and it wasnt too busy i imagine they must get packed on fridaysat night they have outdoor dining outside of their restaurant but highly recommend you try booking a table on their outdoor back patio  super cute and more sheltered from the windcold ambience  5 stars food  4 stars the pasta was light and delicious the smoked mozz pizza we got was a little too heavy for us the chicken pate is to die for but dont gorge yourself like i did or youll have some pretty bad stomach cramps loldrinks  45 stars the sangria is meh but their cocktails are great definitely go for those over the sangria,wonderful cozy place date night covid went sunday night wasnt busy imagine must get packed fridaysat night outdoor dining outside restaurant highly recommend try booking table outdoor back patio super cute sheltered windcold ambience 5 stars food 4 stars pasta light delicious smoked mozz pizza got little heavy us chicken pate die dont gorge like youll pretty bad stomach cramps loldrinks 45 stars sangria meh cocktails great definitely go sangria,wonderful cozy place date night covid went sunday night wasnt busy imagine must packed fridaysat night outdoor dining outside restaurant highly recommend booking table outdoor back patio super cute sheltered windcold ambience 5 stars food 4 stars pasta light delicious smoked mozz pizza little heavy chicken pate die dont gorge like youll pretty bad stomach cramps loldrinks 45 stars sangria meh cocktails great definitely sangria,wonderful cozy place date night covid went sunday night wasnt busy imagine must packed fridaysat night outdoor dining outside restaurant highly recommend booking table outdoor back patio super cute sheltered windcold ambience 5 star food 4 star pasta light delicious smoked mozz pizza little heavy chicken pate die dont gorge like youll pretty bad stomach cramp loldrinks 45 star sangria meh cocktail great definitely sangria,0.15622549019607845,0.6396078431372549

We ordered a variety of small plates to share. Favorites were the butternut squash dumplings (the dumpling wrap was so tender and flavorful!) and burrata. We also ordered 3 pizzas to share and they were all great, especially the starbelly bacon - the pie is topped with an overly generous handful of arugula. The crust is a bit crispy for my liking, but others probably would enjoy. Glad I got to try out another restaurant in the area with a very pleasant experience!","came with a large group on a sunday night. i got reservations here through opentable very easily - there were plenty time and seating options for sunday night. you're also able to pick whether you want to sit outdoors on their covered patio or inside (standard seating).our waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole night. we ordered a variety of small plates to share. favorites were the butternut squash dumplings (the dumpling wrap was so tender and flavorful!) and burrata. we also ordered 3 pizzas to share and they were all great, especially the starbelly bacon - the pie is topped with an overly generous handful of arugula. the crust is a bit crispy for my liking, but others probably would enjoy. glad i got to try out another restaurant in the area with a very pleasant experience!",came with a large group on a sunday night i got reservations here through opentable very easily  there were plenty time and seating options for sunday night youre also able to pick whether you want to sit outdoors on their covered patio or inside standard seatingour waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole night we ordered a variety of small plates to share favorites were the butternut squash dumplings the dumpling wrap was so tender and flavorful and burrata we also ordered 3 pizzas to share and they were all great especially the starbelly bacon  the pie is topped with an overly generous handful of arugula the crust is a bit crispy for my liking but others probably would enjoy glad i got to try out another restaurant in the area with a very pleasant experience,came large group sunday night got reservations opentable easily plenty time seating options sunday night youre also able pick whether want sit outdoors covered patio inside standard seatingour waiter friendly attentive throughout whole night ordered variety small plates share favorites butternut squash dumplings dumpling wrap tender flavorful burrata also ordered 3 pizzas share great especially starbelly bacon pie topped overly generous handful arugula crust bit crispy liking others probably would enjoy glad got try another restaurant area pleasant experience,large group sunday night reservations opentable easily plenty time seating options sunday night youre also able pick whether want sit outdoors covered patio inside standard seatingour waiter friendly attentive throughout whole night ordered variety small plates share favorites butternut squash dumplings dumpling wrap tender flavorful burrata also ordered 3 pizzas share great especially starbelly bacon pie topped overly generous handful arugula crust bit crispy liking others probably enjoy glad another restaurant area pleasant experience,large group sunday night reservation opentable easily plenty time seating option sunday night youre also able pick whether want sit outdoors covered patio inside standard seatingour waiter friendly attentive throughout whole night ordered variety small plate share favorite butternut squash dumpling dumpling wrap tender flavorful burrata also ordered 3 pizza share great especially starbelly bacon pie topped overly generous handful arugula crust bit crispy liking others probably enjoy glad another restaurant area pleasant experience,0.3432823129251701,0.6645408163265306

"Appetizers and pizzas were really solid. The bangers and mash was undercooked the first time with a significant amount of pink left in the sausage. The second plate they brought had less pink but was still visible. After sending the food back a second time, the manager came out and agreed to comp our appetizers, but was defensive on the coloring of the sausage. Highlighting that it is fully cooked despite the color, and it's made in house. However, a friend who got the same dish as me had no visible pink coloring in theirs.","appetizers and pizzas were really solid. the bangers and mash was undercooked the first time with a significant amount of pink left in the sausage. the second plate they brought had less pink but was still visible. after sending the food back a second time, the manager came out and agreed to comp our appetizers, but was defensive on the coloring of the sausage. highlighting that it is fully cooked despite the color, and it's made in house. however, a friend who got the same dish as me had no visible pink coloring in theirs.",appetizers and pizzas were really solid the bangers and mash was undercooked the first time with a significant amount of pink left in the sausage the second plate they brought had less pink but was still visible after sending the food back a second time the manager came out and agreed to comp our appetizers but was defensive on the coloring of the sausage highlighting that it is fully cooked despite the color and its made in house however a friend who got the same dish as me had no visible pink coloring in theirs,appetizers pizzas really solid bangers mash undercooked first time significant amount pink left sausage second plate brought less pink still visible sending food back second time manager came agreed comp appetizers defensive coloring sausage highlighting fully cooked despite color made house however friend got dish visible pink coloring,appetizers pizzas really solid bangers mash undercooked first time significant amount pink left sausage second plate brought less pink still visible sending food back second time manager agreed comp appetizers defensive coloring sausage highlighting fully cooked despite color made house however friend dish visible pink coloring,appetizer pizza really solid banger mash undercooked first time significant amount pink left sausage second plate brought le pink still visible sending food back second time manager agreed comp appetizer defensive coloring sausage highlighting fully cooked despite color made house however friend dish visible pink coloring,0.03250000000000001,0.22083333333333335
"Not only is this an Ocean-Friendly restaurant, meaning this establishment has met/exceeded SurfriderSF's criteria for environmental friendliness, but also this place has a great environment and amazing food! My friend and I were quickly seated on a Monday night, sitting on the outside patio surrounded by adorable plants under a fabric roof. We ate the starbelly salad, potato dumplings, and chorizo pizza. Everything came out in a timely fashion and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and seasonal. The portions were the perfect size and left you full without being in a food coma. The waiters were also super friendly and checked in on us periodically without being overwhelming. Would highly recommend checking this place out if you're on the fence!","not only is this an ocean-friendly restaurant, meaning this establishment has met/exceeded surfridersf's criteria for environmental friendliness, but also this place has a great environment and amazing food! my friend and i were quickly seated on a monday night, sitting on the outside patio surrounded by adorable plants under a fabric roof. we ate the starbelly salad, potato dumplings, and chorizo pizza. everything came out in a timely fashion and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and seasonal. the portions were the perfect size and left you full without being in a food coma. the waiters were also super friendly and checked in on us periodically without being overwhelming. would highly recommend checking this place out if you're on the fence!",not only is this an oceanfriendly restaurant meaning this establishment has metexceeded surfridersfs criteria for environmental friendliness but also this place has a great environment and amazing food my friend and i were quickly seated on a monday night sitting on the outside patio surrounded by adorable plants under a fabric roof we ate the starbelly salad potato dumplings and chorizo pizza everything came out in a timely fashion and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and seasonal the portions were the perfect size and left you full without being in a food coma the waiters were also super friendly and checked in on us periodically without being overwhelming would highly recommend checking this place out if youre on the fence,oceanfriendly restaurant meaning establishment metexceeded surfridersfs criteria environmental friendliness also place great environment amazing food friend quickly seated monday night sitting outside patio surrounded adorable plants fabric roof ate starbelly salad potato dumplings chorizo pizza everything came timely fashion could tell ingredients fresh seasonal portions perfect size left full without food coma waiters also super friendly checked us periodically without overwhelming would highly recommend checking place youre fence,oceanfriendly restaurant meaning establishment metexceeded surfridersfs criteria environmental friendliness also place great environment amazing food friend quickly seated monday night sitting outside patio surrounded adorable plants fabric roof ate starbelly salad potato dumplings chorizo pizza everything timely fashion could tell ingredients fresh seasonal portions perfect size left full without food coma waiters also super friendly checked periodically without overwhelming highly recommend checking place youre fence,oceanfriendly restaurant meaning establishment metexceeded surfridersfs criterion environmental friendliness also place great environment amazing food friend quickly seated monday night sitting outside patio surrounded adorable plant fabric roof ate starbelly salad potato dumpling chorizo pizza everything timely fashion could tell ingredient fresh seasonal portion perfect size left full without food coma waiter also super friendly checked periodically without overwhelming highly recommend checking place youre fence,0.36797619047619046,0.5683333333333332
"11/14/20I just want to start with this, so you don't think this is another one of those f'd up reviews where I'm like... the food's good but I hated my waiter cause he was having a bad day.  NOPE.  This one is 100% the chef.  The food is TERRIBLE.Okay with that out of the way, another thing to note is that I think this might be the strictest restaurant in terms of masks that I've tried yet this #Covid19 #CoronaVirus season.  The irony is that they don't really social distance here, BUT, all the eating spaces are separated by dividers.  Is that enough?--well, I guess that's up to you, but your chair WILL be inches from your neighbors, but with a 3/4ths-height wall or tarp separating you.  To me, I was okay with it, but just FYI.  But again, the mask thing is STRICT.  They even will not put your food down until you've masked up.Okay, so, now for the good stuff...1. Bloody Mary $11 ""vodka, tomato, chile, house-made bacon"":  Alright, I actually liked their bloody mary.  The flavor was strong, and the liquid was modestly thick and smooth.  I could use a tad more alcohol, but it was fine for brunch.  No real heat though unfortunately.  7/102. Starbelly Salad $12 ""with leaf lettuce, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, salt & pepper vinaigrette"":  So, read the description--cause that's EXACTLY what you're getting.  That's correct, $12 for sorta-fresh lettuce, kinda like the stuff you get in those mixed green bags at the supermarket.  Tomatoes.  And... the world's most basic dressing.  TWELVE DOLLA'S.  Absolutely zero effort here.  1.5/103. Sunnyside Joe's $13 ""lost coast ground beef, cheddar, onions & spinach, potatoes"":  So this was interesting--it's kinda like their version of a loco moco (which they also had on the menu)?  There's a hamburger patty underneath the spinach and cheese.  Um, yeah, well, that's what it is--patty, spinach, and cheese.  Egg on top.  OH, and the sunny side-up eggs were overcooked as the yolk was half cooked through, BUT strangely, some of the white was still raw and snotty.  The patty was VERY overcooked, and strangely gamey tasting, though I didn't mind the flavor cause I like that sort of thing.  But the meat itself was quite dry, but luckily there was lots of moisture from the spinach and gooey cheese.  The potatoes were lightly fried, and had a good oven-baked flavor.  Overall it tasted okay, despite the overcooked patty.  5/104. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles $16 ""maple syrup"":  BAD.  One of the WORST chicken & waffles of my life.  Nothing wrong with the waffles themselves, but nothing worth noting either.  BUT, the chicken... wow.  Bricks.  They used white meat, and waaaaaaaaay overcooked them.  Also, the coating was not crisp.  So yeah, mushy coating over bricks.  It should be noted that the white meat was thin, and not even a whole piece of breast, which could have helped with the cooking level if it were.  They must have taken a piece of breast and cut it down 4 times or so to less than 1/2"" thickness.  It's very hard to cook a thin piece of breast to be moist.  So, yeah, it wasn't.  What a crappy way to spend sixteen bucks.  1/105. Cornmeal-Fried Fish Tacos $10 ""house pickled jalapeno & spicy slaw"":  The fish itself tasted fresh, but was overcooked (story of the day) so it was pretty dry.  But worst of all........ there was BARELY any fish at all!  Like seriously.... I get that times are tough, but do we really need to be rationing food like this as if the city was in the middle of a famine???  The tacos were like 80% cabbage.  Seriously.  Just look at my pics--tell me if you can find the fish k?  Oh and the coating wasn't crisp... (you knew I was gonna say that right?)  2/10And lastly, there was a ""SF Mandate"" charge on my bill.  You know how I feel about mystery charges, aka las vegas resort fees.  Work it into your prices like moral businesses would.  Don't surprise people at the end.  How would you like it if you bought a new car for $40k and find that they charged you a $2k worker's health insurance fee?  Wtf right?Just no.1/5#sanfrancisco #americanbrunch #americanfood #star #americancuisine #americanbreakfast","11/14/20i just want to start with this, so you don't think this is another one of those f'd up reviews where i'm like... the food's good but i hated my waiter cause he was having a bad day. nope. this one is 100% the chef. the food is terrible.okay with that out of the way, another thing to note is that i think this might be the strictest restaurant in terms of masks that i've tried yet this #covid19 #coronavirus season. the irony is that they don't really social distance here, but, all the eating spaces are separated by dividers. is that enough?--well, i guess that's up to you, but your chair will be inches from your neighbors, but with a 3/4ths-height wall or tarp separating you. to me, i was okay with it, but just fyi. but again, the mask thing is strict. they even will not put your food down until you've masked up.okay, so, now for the good stuff...1. bloody mary $11 ""vodka, tomato, chile, house-made bacon"": alright, i actually liked their bloody mary. the flavor was strong, and the liquid was modestly thick and smooth. i could use a tad more alcohol, but it was fine for brunch. no real heat though unfortunately. 7/102. starbelly salad $12 ""with leaf lettuce, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, salt & pepper vinaigrette"": so, read the description--cause that's exactly what you're getting. that's correct, $12 for sorta-fresh lettuce, kinda like the stuff you get in those mixed green bags at the supermarket. tomatoes. and... the world's most basic dressing. twelve dolla's. absolutely zero effort here. 1.5/103. sunnyside joe's $13 ""lost coast ground beef, cheddar, onions & spinach, potatoes"": so this was interesting--it's kinda like their version of a loco moco (which they also had on the menu)? there's a hamburger patty underneath the spinach and cheese. um, yeah, well, that's what it is--patty, spinach, and cheese. egg on top. oh, and the sunny side-up eggs were overcooked as the yolk was half cooked through, but strangely, some of the white was still raw and snotty. the patty was very overcooked, and strangely gamey tasting, though i didn't mind the flavor cause i like that sort of thing. but the meat itself was quite dry, but luckily there was lots of moisture from the spinach and gooey cheese. the potatoes were lightly fried, and had a good oven-baked flavor. overall it tasted okay, despite the overcooked patty. 5/104. buttermilk fried chicken & waffles $16 ""maple syrup"": bad. one of the worst chicken & waffles of my life. nothing wrong with the waffles themselves, but nothing worth noting either. but, the chicken... wow. bricks. they used white meat, and waaaaaaaaay overcooked them. also, the coating was not crisp. so yeah, mushy coating over bricks. it should be noted that the white meat was thin, and not even a whole piece of breast, which could have helped with the cooking level if it were. they must have taken a piece of breast and cut it down 4 times or so to less than 1/2"" thickness. it's very hard to cook a thin piece of breast to be moist. so, yeah, it wasn't. what a crappy way to spend sixteen bucks. 1/105. cornmeal-fried fish tacos $10 ""house pickled jalapeno & spicy slaw"": the fish itself tasted fresh, but was overcooked (story of the day) so it was pretty dry. but worst of all........ there was barely any fish at all! like seriously.... i get that times are tough, but do we really need to be rationing food like this as if the city was in the middle of a famine??? the tacos were like 80% cabbage. seriously. just look at my pics--tell me if you can find the fish k? oh and the coating wasn't crisp...

"Came here to celebrate our anniversary and though it wasn't the best meal I have had, it didn't disappoint. I liked the food and ambience here.  It's got a modern vibe with sidewalk booths, inside seating, and a back patio area with warm lighting. Online reservation was easy and convenient and we were seated promptly. We got here at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. I noticed plenty of to-go orders during our time here, even saw folks getting to-go drinks.Indoor tables were well spaced out, there was 1 other party in our area. We were asked to keep our masks on when the server approached the table. Service was prompt but wasn't particularly friendly and not on par with other establishments. Hence the 4 stars.We got 2 cocktails  - the Otro Diablo which was on the sweeter side and the margarita mezcal which was more balanced.

"BEWARE OF DECEPTIVE MENU AND PAYMENT TERMINAL!!Disappointed after reading the glowing reviews here. The food was just OK, nothing crazy special though the vegetarian burger had some fun twists to it. What really upset me is the lack of transparency in their pricing.As we walked in we were handed a menu identical to the one displayed at the door. The prices are listed as $15 for the burger(s) and a 4% healthy sf charge. And yet our final check has the burgers at $16 and a 5% healthy SF charge. That's unacceptable.They use Toast and the machine provides tip suggestions which calculates tip using the post-tax total (so you tip on tax and healthy SF, which is not service). As the healthy sf charge is included in the pre-tax total you basically have to work out the total yourself and then use the custom tip option. It's a very deceptive and shady practice and is different to most other restaurants I've been to.","beware of deceptive menu and payment terminal!!disappointed after reading the glowing reviews here. the food was just ok, nothing crazy special though the vegetarian burger had some fun twists to it. what really upset me is the lack of transparency in their pricing.as we walked in we were handed a menu identical to the one displayed at the door. the prices are listed as $15 for the burger(s) and a 4% healthy sf charge. and yet our final check has the burgers at $16 and a 5% healthy sf charge. that's unacceptable.they use toast and the machine provides tip suggestions which calculates tip using the post-tax total (so you tip on tax and healthy sf, which is not service). as the healthy sf charge is included in the pre-tax total you basically have to work out the total yourself and then use the custom tip option. it's a very deceptive and shady practice and is different to most other restaurants i've been to.",beware of deceptive menu and payment terminaldisappointed after reading the glowing reviews here the food was just ok nothing crazy special though the vegetarian burger had some fun twists to it what really upset me is the lack of transparency in their pricingas we walked in we were handed a menu identical to the one displayed at the door the prices are listed as 15 for the burgers and a 4 healthy sf charge and yet our final check has the burgers at 16 and a 5 healthy sf charge thats unacceptablethey use toast and the machine provides tip suggestions which calculates tip using the posttax total so you tip on tax and healthy sf which is not service as the healthy sf charge is included in the pretax total you basically have to work out the total yourself and then use the custom tip option its a very deceptive and shady practice and is different to most other restaurants ive been to,beware deceptive menu payment terminaldisappointed reading glowing reviews food ok nothing crazy special though vegetarian burger fun twists really upset lack transparency pricingas walked handed menu identical one displayed door prices listed 15 burgers 4 healthy sf charge yet final check burgers 16 5 healthy sf charge thats unacceptablethey use toast machine provides tip suggestions calculates tip using posttax total tip tax healthy sf service healthy sf charge included pretax total basically work total use custom tip option deceptive shady practice different restaurants ive,beware deceptive menu payment terminaldisappointed reading glowing reviews food ok nothing crazy special though vegetarian burger fun twists really upset lack transparency pricingas walked handed menu identical displayed door prices listed 15 burgers 4 healthy sf charge yet final check burgers 16 5 healthy sf charge thats unacceptablethey use toast machine provides tip suggestions calculates tip using posttax total tip tax healthy sf service healthy sf charge included pretax total basically work total use custom tip option deceptive shady practice different restaurants ive,beware deceptive menu payment terminaldisappointed reading glowing review food ok nothing crazy special though vegetarian burger fun twist really upset lack transparency pricingas walked handed menu identical displayed door price listed 15 burger 4 healthy sf charge yet final check burger 16 5 healthy sf charge thats unacceptablethey use toast machine provides tip suggestion calculates tip using posttax total tip tax healthy sf service healthy sf charge included pretax total basically work total use custom tip option deceptive shady practice different restaurant ive,0.16714285714285715,0.5897619047619048

We haven't ordered cocktails or anything, just soft drinks.  Update: one of the burgers was missing bacon and cheddar, someone ordered a burger, and wasn't offered a side, the fries were not crispy as they could have been and not very salted. I ordered the fried chicken and French toast. It was interesting in the regard that it could have been more flavourful.  The French toast was more eggy than I would like it to be.

"I used to really like Starbelly pre pandemic. However, I think it's gone a bit downhill. I am pretty patient these days as I know places are struggling. However, I had a pretty poor service experience not just once but twice. When I decided to give them a second chance, the service was almost just as poor as the first experience. When we sat outside on our first experience, our waiter was just terrible. We were a table of 5 and everyone thought the server might've been high since he was a bit aloof and forgot everything we asked of him. We had to ask for things several times before they were brought to us. He also never visited our table to see how we were doing after those items arrived or if we wanted to order additional items. And in the end, he left from his shift without telling us or transitioning us to a new server. So we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our check and the waiter had left the premise. We went and explained our poor service experience to the folks at the front and were shrugged off. I even later wrote to the manager about it, instead of sharing it on Yelp, and was shrugged off once again. Feeling it might be a covid related fluke, we decided to give them another try. Again everything was disjointed. We ordered two starters and two mains and everything arrived at once not allowing us to enjoy our starter courses. Our table was also broken but we couldn't move to another one so we pretty much had to hold the table together while we used our knife and fork to cut, hoping the table wouldn't fall apart. Also, the food we ordered wasn't as good as it used to be. Same with the cocktails. I had been a regular at Starbelly. But now the service is definitely lacking, the food not as good anymore, and most importantly they don't seem to care if you have a positive or negative experience. With all the other great restaurants in the neighborhood, I'm taking Starbelly off my list. I want to support folks who care about their customers.","i used to really like starbelly pre pandemic. however, i think it's gone a bit downhill. i am pretty patient these days as i know places are

"Super cute, love the patio, food was pretty good, but nothing amazing. Service was wonderful.Stopped in on a Sunday for a very late brunch. Got seated immediately, service was excellent. We originally sat inside, but they saw that I couldn't really hear my partner, and they helpped us move outside to the patio. One thing, there is only one bathroom, so just don't wait till it's urgent to go. The patio was a wonderful space. Super cute with lots of plants a full roll up sunshade. Food was good, not amazing. The French toast was a lot of fun. And we got the something Joe's which was basically a loco moco but instead of rice there were veggies. which honestly was a great idea especially for keto. Overall, cute not too pricey, and a good spot if you're looking for a good brunch with friends. For sure gonna try and come back and try dinner.

"Starbelly has been on my to-try brunch list for a while and I finally got the chance last week. My friend was back in town from HK, we grew up together in the city and were in search of a new place to try out. The restaurant is contemporary and casual with communal tables in the main dining area and picnic tables in the outdoor patio, they also have parklet seating out front. We were seated at a high table in the main dining area and were quickly greeted by a staff member. We ordered the Chicken Liver Pate w/Sweet Onion Marmalade - this is THE dish to order. The pate was smooth and decadent and the sweet onion marmalade made for the perfect blend of flavors. I tried the Fried Chicken & French Toast - fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. French Toast was big enough to share, I ended up eating only half of one toast! My friend tried the Chilaquiles with a side salad which was tasty and also equally as huge as my dish. Overall beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, and delicious food - I will be back to try other dishes on the menu soon.","starbelly has been on my to-try brunch list for a while and i finally got the chance last week. my friend was back in town from hk, we grew up together in the city and were in search of a new place to try out. the restaurant is contemporary and casual with communal tables in the main dining area and picnic tables in the outdoor patio, they also have parklet seating out front. we were seated at a high table in the main dining area and were quickly greeted by a staff member. we ordered the chicken liver pate w/sweet onion marmalade - this is the dish to order. the pate was smooth and decadent and the sweet onion marmalade made for the perfect blend of flavors. i tried the fried chicken & french toast - fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. french toast was big enough to share, i ended up eating only half of one toast! my friend tried the chilaquiles with a side salad which was tasty and also equally as huge as my dish. overall beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, and delicious food - i will be back to try other dishes on the menu soon.",starbelly has been on my totry brunch list for a while and i finally got the chance last week my friend was back in town from hk we grew up together in the city and were in search of a new place to try out the restaurant is contemporary and casual with communal tables in the main dining area and picnic tables in the outdoor patio they also have parklet seating out front we were seated at a high table in the main dining area and were quickly greeted by a staff member we ordered the chicken liver pate wsweet onion marmalade  this is the dish to order the pate was smooth and decadent and the sweet onion marmalade made for the perfect blend of flavors i tried the fried chicken  french toast  fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside french toast was big enough to share i ended up eating only half of one toast my friend tried the chilaquiles with a side salad which was tasty and also equally as huge as my dish overall beautiful restaurant friendly staff and delicious food  i will be back to try other dishes on the menu soon,starbelly totry brunch list finally got chance last week friend back town hk grew together city search new place try restaurant contemporary casual communal tables main dining area picnic tables outdoor patio also parklet seating front seated high table main dining area quickly greeted staff member ordered chicken liver pate wsweet onion marmalade dish order pate smooth decadent sweet onion marmalade made perfect blend flavors tried fried chicken french toast fried chicken crispy outside juicy inside french toast big enough share ended eating half one toast friend tried chilaquiles side salad tasty also equally huge dish overall beautiful restaurant friendly staff delicious food back try dishes menu soon,starbelly totry brunch list finally chance last week friend back town hk grew together city search new place restaurant contemporary casual communal tables main dining area picnic tables outdoor patio also parklet seating front seated high table main dining area quickly greeted staff member ordered chicken liver pate wsweet onion marmalade dish order pate smooth decadent sweet onion marmalade made perfect blend flavors tried fried chicken french toast fried chicken crispy outside juicy inside french toast big enough share ended eating half toast friend tried chilaquiles side salad tasty also equally huge dish overall beautiful restaurant friendly staff delicious food back dishes menu soon,starbelly totry brunch list finally chance last week friend back town hk grew together city search new place restaurant contemporary casual communal table main dining area picnic table outdoor patio also parklet seating front seated high table main dining area quickly greeted staff member ordered chicken liver pate wsweet onion marmalade dish order pate smooth decadent sweet onion marmalade made perfect blend flavor tried fried chicken french toast fried chicken crispy outside juicy inside french toast big enough share ended eating half toast friend tried chilaquiles side salad tasty also equally huge dish overall beautiful restaurant friendly staff delicious food back dish menu soon,0.10850108225108224,0.48135281385281387

"A casual yet elegant cozy setting serving flavorful comfort menu items in the heart of the Castro! Worth a stop! Was here with a small group on a Saturday evening - outdoor and indoor dining options currently available. Seated promptly without a reservation ~7 pm. I ordered the starbelly bacon pizza which was topped with jalapeño, arugula and a green goddess dressing smooth with a hint of tarragon and creamy mayonnaise, sour cream that permeated the wealth of existing aromas. The crust was crisp, toasted with a crunch and not doughy or stuffy, but risen, thin to the center but held its integrity against the enriching blend of tomato sauce and dressing. Bacon bits were finely diced and fried to allow bitesized fulfillment with every mouthful of chewing. The arugula was a great compliment to the fatty but guilty delight of bacon - with fresh greenness and its characteristic almost pungent fragrance immersed well as a component of the whole. Unfortunately, the jalapeno seeds were removed - a little more spice would serve the pizza well!  Had the turmeric tonic - a good blend of lemon essence with a hint of ginger sprightly, punchy and inviting. Would want to come back and try their brunch menu some time!","a casual yet elegant cozy setting serving flavorful comfort menu items in the heart of the castro! worth a stop! was here with a small group on a saturday evening - outdoor and indoor dining options currently available. seated promptly without a reservation ~7 pm. i ordered the starbelly bacon pizza which was topped with jalapeño, arugula and a green goddess dressing smooth with a hint of tarragon and creamy mayonnaise, sour cream that permeated the wealth of existing aromas. the crust was crisp, toasted with a crunch and not doughy or stuffy, but risen, thin to the center but held its integrity against the enriching blend of tomato sauce and dressing. bacon bits were finely diced and fried to allow bitesized fulfillment with every mouthful of chewing. the arugula was a great compliment to the fatty but guilty delight of bacon - with fresh greenness and its characteristic almost pungent fragrance immersed well as a component of the whole. unfortunately, the jalapeno seeds were removed - a little more spice would serve the pizza well!

"Very limited menu! This place is just a place for brunch and alcohol - we came for weekend lunch and there was not a single vegetarian sandwich option. I saw a veggie burger option online but was told it was not part of the brunch menu. If they offer these options at other times, why not for weekend lunch? The servers seemed genuinely offended that I asked for a vegetarian option and, when I settled on a fish taco, could not offer me a non egg/mayo based sauce or even a simple vegetable or two so it wasn't dry. I ended up with a tortilla and fried fish.

"I came here on a Sunday for brunch because our first option was closed but this was a decent backup plan.  We walked in without any reservations and managed to get seated immediately for indoor dining.  The outdoor seating in their parklet and private back patio looked full though.I got the Sunnyside Joe's and overall it was fine - nothing special and could use a few improvements.  The ground beef patty was bland but the onions, spinach, and cheese helped add some flavor.  The eggs weren't completely runny and some of the yolk was cooked through.  Kind of a bummer since sunnyside up is pretty much in the name of the dish.  I like cheesy things so it was nice seeing all the melted cheese on top.  It did leave the whole dish a bit oily though and salty on certain bites.  The side of crispy potatoes was a winner though.","i came here on a sunday for brunch because our first option was closed but this was a decent backup plan. we walked in without any reservations and managed to get seated immediately for indoor dining. the outdoor seating in their parklet and private back patio looked full though.i got the sunnyside joe's and overall it was fine - nothing special and could use a few improvements. the ground beef patty was bland but the onions, spinach, and cheese helped add some flavor. the eggs weren't completely runny and some of the yolk was cooked through. kind of a bummer since sunnyside up is pretty much in the name of the dish. i like cheesy things so it was nice seeing all the melted cheese on top. it did leave the whole dish a bit oily though and salty on certain bites. the side of crispy potatoes was a winner though.",i came here on a sunday for brunch because our first option was closed but this was a decent backup plan we walked in without any reservations and managed to get seated immediately for indoor dining the outdoor seating in their parklet and private back patio looked full thoughi got the sunnyside joes and overall it was fine  nothing special and could use a few improvements the ground beef patty was bland but the onions spinach and cheese helped add some flavor the eggs werent completely runny and some of the yolk was cooked through kind of a bummer since sunnyside up is pretty much in the name of the dish i like cheesy things so it was nice seeing all the melted cheese on top it did leave the whole dish a bit oily though and salty on certain bites the side of crispy potatoes was a winner though,came sunday brunch first option closed decent backup plan walked without reservations managed get seated immediately indoor dining outdoor seating parklet private back patio looked full thoughi got sunnyside joes overall fine nothing special could use improvements ground beef patty bland onions spinach cheese helped add flavor eggs werent completely runny yolk cooked kind bummer since sunnyside pretty much name dish like cheesy things nice seeing melted cheese top leave whole dish bit oily though salty certain bites side crispy potatoes winner though,sunday brunch first option closed decent backup plan walked without reservations managed seated immediately indoor dining outdoor seating parklet private back patio looked full thoughi sunnyside joes overall fine nothing special could use improvements ground beef patty bland onions spinach cheese helped add flavor eggs werent completely runny yolk cooked kind bummer since sunnyside pretty much name dish like cheesy things nice seeing melted cheese top leave whole dish bit oily though salty certain bites side crispy potatoes winner though,sunday brunch first option closed decent backup plan walked without reservation managed seated immediately indoor dining outdoor seating parklet private back patio looked full thoughi sunnyside joes overall fine nothing special could use improvement ground beef patty bland onion spinach cheese helped add flavor egg werent completely runny yolk cooked kind bummer since sunnyside pretty much name dish like cheesy thing nice seeing melted cheese top leave whole dish bit oily though salty certain bite side crispy potato winner though,0.18095238095238098,0.5211152882205514

"In 2020, there's no shortage of Brunch spots in any major city, and SF is no exception. On my latest trip to SF, I happened to stop by Starbelly with a friend as a Brunch part 2 for my Saturday morning. We made a reservation and it was definitely helpful, even for our 1pm reservation, there were a handful of people who were walk-ins and ended up having to wait. The location is easy to get to, and it's right off of Market, so it's a nice walk if you're in the area.Starbelly has a fairly straightforward menu, and doesn't disappoint in its selection. It's standard brunch fare, but good options all around. As this was my 2nd Brunch of the day, I decided to go the dessert route and tried the Challah French Toast. I can wholeheartedly say it was a good experience and a worthwhile option! Starbelly's drinks don't disappoint, and most people will find something that fits their palate. My friend got a coffee, but I personally went for the diet cola, and the local offering is Boylan's. An expensive soda, yes, but worth it in my opinion. Of course, not every restaurant is perfect...Starbelly has two main weaknesses that I saw while being there for brunch. First, even for a non-peak brunch time, the inner ambient volume is excessive if you're trying to have a normal conversation. Not sure if it's the acoustics or just how the restaurant is laid out, but my friend and I found ourselves just shy of yelling to get any communication back and forth. Second, there were a couple of times we were left waiting for staff for 15-20 minutes after we'd asked for something. Definitely not the end of the world, but also a little disappointing for an upscale restaurant during non-peak times. Overall, I'd still say Starbelly is worth a try! It's a good option that's likely to appease most brunch goers, and has a nice vibe and aesthetic.","in 2020, there's no shortage of brunch spots in any major city, and sf is no exception. on my latest trip to sf, i happened to stop by starbelly with a friend as a brunch part 2 for my saturday morning. we made a reservation and it was definitely helpful, even for our 1pm reservation, there were a handful of people who were walk-ins and ended up having to wait. the location is easy to get to, and it's right off of market, so it's a nice walk if you're in the area.starbelly has a fairly straightforward menu, and doesn't disappoint in its selection. it's standard brunch fare, but good options all around. as this was my 2nd brunch of the day, i decided to go the dessert route and tried the challah french toast. i can wholeheartedly say it was a good experience and a worthwhile option! starbelly's drinks don't disappoint, and most people will find something that fits their palate. my friend got a coffee, but i personally went for the diet cola, and the local offering is boylan's. an expensive soda, yes, but worth it in my opinion. of course, not every restaurant is

"This place was a last minute choice as my son and I were manning our sales booth for the Slowly Noe Street Art Mart. One never knows about what's open Sundays in the city. I happened to overhear some passerby mentioning StarBelly to someone and found it while Yelping for places open. After looking over the online menu, it not only sounded like a great all around place, but the prices were reasonable as well. I flagged a waiter and he led me inside the lobby to order. The place smelled heavenly - like challah bread!  A few people were seated inside Dara apart. I ordered the StarBelly pizza - complete w their signature bacon, arugula on top and the mozzarella cheese on half of the pizza. Added their ground Chuck burger with a side salad, potato wedges fries w three sauces. I then went outside to wait. Ended up having a LONG chat with a friendly lady with her dog, and saw the waiter coming to me (a business away!) with my order!  So glad I'd tipped him well!!!The pizza - aaaahhhh!  Nice thin crust but with some umph, very tasty sauce and the green goddess dressing atop the arugula-sprinkled pizza!  According to my son the cheese part was, ""mmmmm!""  The salad with it was big enough for a meal itself!  The goat cheese made it so even a lactose intolerant person could eat it. The dressing light and on target without an overpowering or greasy feeling. The fries were generously good though I felt the sauces (ketchup, orange and green - unknown flavors, look up on menu) weren't all that exciting and somewhat bland. Even a kick of salt or spice on one might have helped them. And now we reach the burger!  It's a Dagwood Bumstead sized burger!!!  On a sesame seeded challah round bun, lots of lettuce, red onions, I added a side of bacon (2) slices, and tomato!  Wow!  Best deal on the menu!!!Definitely going back to StarBelly!","this place was a last minute choice as my son and i were manning our sales booth for the slowly noe street art mart. one never knows about

"I went to 3 places for SF Restaurant Week, and out of the 3, this was my favorite. 1. PRICE - at lunch, it was a 3 course meal for $15.15. What?! This exists in San Francisco??2. QUALITY - Not only was it very affordable, but the quality of food was impressive. Chicken liver pate with sweet onion marmalade, grain mustard, and butterbread, fried chicken po'boy, and salted caramel pot de creme, with a cornmeal rosemary cookie. The chicken liver pate is already amazing in itself, but when you combine it with sweet onion marmalade and mustard and spread it on butterbread, wow what a burst of flavor. Very rich appetizer. Then comes the savory fried chicken po'boy, solid burger. And top off the meal not just any cookie, but a cornmeal rosemary cookie complementing a salted caramel pot de creme. I believe this was one of my most memorable lunches for the start of 2020. 3. AMBIANCE - OUTDOOR PATIO IS SO FREAKIN CUTE 4. SERVICE - great, refilled waters, brought food in a reasonable time, didn't feel rushed. 5. LOCATION - great location in Castro. I'm happy I discovered this place during SFRW, and I'd definitely come back, especially for the chicken liver pate and salted caramel pot de creme dessert!","i went to 3 places for sf restaurant week, and out of the 3, this was my favorite. 1. price - at lunch, it was a 3 course meal for $15.15. what?!

"I live 2 blocks away and have eaten here many times. They do some things consistently well and other things not so well. I like their burger, their pasta with bacon, and their pizzas. I've gone for lunch twice, first time I got the chicken and waffle and chicken was over cooked. Today, I came here on a lunch date and ordered the chicken po'boy based on server's recommendation and the chicken was inedible. It tasted like it was a cheap frozen piece of chicken they'd dethawed multiple times. Very hard to chew and unpleasant. I wanted to send it back but it was a first date and didn't want to come off bad. So I instead took the chicken out of the sandwich and just ate the bread with the condiments and I guess that could also make me look like a pushover on the date, so also bad. I've had other bad experiences here but also good ones. I like this restaurant but it's really inconsistent. So if I ever do come back, I'll stick to the burger or pasta and not venture out again. And I'll definitely stay away from any chicken dishes they have bc the chicken was so bad. Ambiance and decor is nice though.","i live 2 blocks away and have eaten here many times. they do some things consistently well and other things not so well. i like their burger, their pasta with bacon, and their pizzas. i've gone for lunch twice, first time i got the chicken and waffle and chicken was over cooked. today, i came here on a lunch date and ordered the chicken po'boy based on server's recommendation and the chicken was inedible. it tasted like it was a cheap frozen piece of chicken they'd dethawed multiple times. very hard to chew and unpleasant. i wanted to send it back but it was a first date and didn't want to come off bad. so i instead took the chicken out of the sandwich and just ate the bread with the condiments and i guess that could also make me look like a pushover on the date, so also bad. i've had other bad experiences here but also good ones. i like this restaurant but it's really inconsistent. so if i ever do come back, i'll stick to the burger or pasta and not venture out again. and i'll definitely stay away from any chicken dishes they have bc the chicken was so bad. ambiance and decor is nice though.",i live 2 blocks away and have eaten here many times they do some things consistently well and other things not so well i like their burger their pasta with bacon and their pizzas ive gone for lunch twice first time i got the chicken and waffle and chicken was over cooked today i came here on a lunch date and ordered the chicken poboy based on servers recommendation and the chicken was inedible it tasted like it was a cheap frozen piece of chicken theyd dethawed multiple times very hard to chew and unpleasant i wanted to send it back but it was a first date and didnt want to come off bad so i instead took the chicken out of the sandwich and just ate the bread with the condiments and i guess that could also make me look like a pushover on the date so also bad ive had other bad experiences here but also good ones i like this restaurant but its really inconsistent so if i ever do come back ill stick to the burger or pasta and not venture out again and ill definitely stay away from any chicken dishes they have bc the chicken was so bad ambiance and decor is nice though,live 2 blocks away eaten many times things consistently well things well like burger pasta bacon pizzas ive gone lunch twice first time got chicken waffle chicken cooked today came lunch date ordered chicken poboy based servers recommendation chicken inedible tasted like cheap frozen piece chicken theyd dethawed multiple times hard chew unpleasant wanted send back first date didnt want come bad instead took chicken sandwich ate bread condiments guess could also make look like pushover date also bad ive bad experiences also good ones like restaurant really inconsistent ever come back ill stick burger pasta venture ill definitely stay away chicken dishes bc chicken bad ambiance decor nice though,live 2 blocks away eaten many times things consistently well things well like burger pasta bacon pizzas ive gone lunch twice first time chicken waffle chicken cooked today lunch date ordered chicken poboy based servers recommendation chicken inedible tasted like cheap frozen piece chicken theyd dethawed multiple times hard chew unpleasant wanted send back first date didnt want come bad instead took chicken sandwich ate bread condiments guess could also make look like pushover date also bad ive bad experiences also good ones like restaurant really inconsistent ever come back ill stick burger pasta venture ill definitely stay away chicken dishes bc chicken bad ambiance decor nice though,live 2 block away eaten many time thing consistently well thing well like burger pasta bacon pizza ive gone lunch twice first time chicken waffle chicken cooked today lunch date ordered chicken poboy based server recommendation chicken inedible tasted like cheap frozen piece chicken theyd dethawed multiple time hard chew unpleasant wanted send back first date didnt want come bad instead took chicken sandwich ate bread condiment guess could also make look like pushover date also bad ive bad experience also good one like restaurant really inconsistent ever come back ill stick burger pasta venture ill definitely stay away chicken dish bc chicken bad ambiance decor nice though,-0.21570010449320792,0.6439655172413792
"My friend and I decided to go to this place on Saturday night in the last minute, so we didn't have reservations, and we waited for like 30mins in the back patio. We were not super hungry, so we ordered few small bites. The most impressive one was def the squash dumplings. It had roasted nuts and the squash was really smooth! The lamb meatballs were also very tasty too. I like the lamb flavor, this one has the flavor but it's not too strong to cover other spices smell, it was perfect blended. The chorizo pizza was perfectly moisture and all the toppings were proportional too, which made every bites equally amazing! The sweet potato soup was kinda out of our expectations, it was good for sure, but we were expecting more like pumpkin soup kind of sweet soup. Overall, we had a good time in this restaurant and will for sure revisit!","my friend and i decided to go to this place on saturday night in the last minute, so we didn't have reservations, and we waited for like 30mins in the back patio. we were not super hungry, so we ordered few small bites. the most impressive one was def the squash dumplings. it had roasted nuts and the squash was really smooth! the lamb meatballs were also very tasty too. i like the lamb flavor, this one has the flavor but it's not too strong to cover other spices smell, it was perfect blended. the chorizo pizza was perfectly moisture and all the toppings were proportional too, which made every bites equally amazing! the sweet potato soup was kinda out of our expectations, it was good for sure, but we were expecting more like pumpkin soup kind of sweet soup. overall, we had a good time in this restaurant and will for sure revisit!",my friend and i decided to go to this place on saturday night in the last minute so we didnt have reservations and we waited for like 30mins in the back patio we were not super hungry so we ordered few small bites the most impressive one was def the squash dumplings it had roasted nuts and the squash was really smooth the lamb meatballs were also very tasty too i like the lamb flavor this one has the flavor but its not too strong to cover other spices smell it was perfect blended the chorizo pizza was perfectly moisture and all the toppings were proportional too which made every bites equally amazing the sweet potato soup was kinda out of our expectations it was good for sure but we were expecting more like pumpkin soup kind of sweet soup overall we had a good time in this restaurant and will for sure revisit,friend decided go place saturday night last minute didnt reservations waited like 30mins back patio super hungry ordered small bites impressive one def squash dumplings roasted nuts squash really smooth lamb meatballs also tasty like lamb flavor one flavor strong cover spices smell perfect blended chorizo pizza perfectly moisture toppings proportional made every bites equally amazing sweet potato soup kinda expectations good sure expecting like pumpkin soup kind sweet soup overall good time restaurant sure revisit,friend decided place saturday night last minute didnt reservations waited like 30mins back patio super hungry ordered small bites impressive def squash dumplings roasted nuts squash really smooth lamb meatballs also tasty like lamb flavor flavor strong cover spices smell perfect blended chorizo pizza perfectly moisture toppings proportional made every bites equally amazing sweet potato soup kinda expectations good sure expecting like pumpkin soup kind sweet soup overall good time restaurant sure revisit,friend decided place saturday night last minute didnt reservation waited like 30mins back patio super hungry ordered small bite impressive def squash dumpling roasted nut squash really smooth lamb meatball also tasty like lamb flavor flavor strong cover spice smell perfect blended chorizo pizza perfectly moisture topping proportional made every bite equally amazing sweet potato soup kinda expectation good sure expecting like pumpkin soup kind sweet soup overall good time restaurant sure revisit,0.4564814814814815,0.6358024691358026

"I absolutely loved this restaurant. Thank you yelp for sending us here!They had a really nice booths built outside that were over and above what I imagine the Covid regulations are. I also love that they had a little note on the table saying that you need to wear your mask anytime one of the staff members were at your table for everyones safety. It was huge for me and the experience I had, that the restaurant cared enough about its employees to do what they could to ensure their safety.So, the food. We were here in summer so I had the privilege of eating their corn pizza which is to date, the best pizza I have ever had. I wasn't sure what to expect but it had everything that you want in a Pizza and more. It was fresh, cheesy, flavorful, hot, literally everything. Accompanied with one of their delicious cocktails that I overindulged on, it was my favorite Meal in San Francisco that weekend we were visiting. My boyfriend was also obsessed with his food (shame on me for not remembering what he ordered). We left here so happy. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was also a delight. I would love to come back here when this restaurant is operating under normal circumstances because the ambience inside seemed so quaint and cute when I went to the restroom I most likely could stay there all day if given the option. We will definitely be back in the future, that's a guarantee.","i absolutely loved this restaurant. thank you yelp for sending us here!they had a really nice booths built outside that were over and

"I'm a fan of Starbelly's brunch.My significant other planned a date-day and asked if I could come here early to get a spot. It was around 10:30 am, after a recently rainy period. Having sat in the front portion of the restaurant, I asked if we could sit in the back patio area. The 30-35 minute wait turned into only a 10 minute wait, and the host asked if I wanted to close out my bar tab and get seated right away. ""We would need to ask you to leave by 12:45 for the reservation."" She asked nicely.Absolutely. That's quite some time.Once my significant other arrived, we shared a Loco Moco, a Pizza, and a french toast. Everything, as I remembered, was very tasty. The portions were decently sized for the individual, and among the two of us, we finished everything.The server kept coming back to refill my water and it was a great experience.I would say that this place is fantastic if you catch it on a good day without a wait. Typically there's at least a 30 min-1 hour wait, depending on the weekend, which makes this place great but harder to justify.","i'm a fan of starbelly's brunch.my significant other planned a date-day and asked if i could come here early to get a spot. it was around 10:30 am, after a recently rainy period. having sat in the front portion of the restaurant, i asked if we could sit in the back patio area. the 30-35 minute wait turned into only a 10 minute wait, and the host asked if i wanted to close out my bar tab and get seated right away.

It is best piece of pork belly that i've tasted EVER.I got a spaghetti with pork belly upon the server's recommendation and I was so glad that I did because it was the best dish I had while staying in San Francisco. The only two disappointing things were1) it took me good 8 minutes to be greeted and sat at a table.2) was told that I could only dine in if I can finish and leave in 45 minutes. I was a party of 1 so I wasn't too opposed by it but let's be real. I was a little offended. It also seemed a little rough to make this happen as the food itself took 27 minutes to come out, for a spaghetti. I had less than 20 minutes to finish it. But i still give 5 star because the server was nice and kind and helpful.

"Overall a very solid place, with a few misses: Good ambience, good food, good drinks (with 1 exception), good service (with 1 exception). Reservations through OpenTable are convenient and straightfoward. COVID precautions: I appreciate that they take COVID seriously with their mask rules, generous spacing between tables, and QR menus. They require you to put your mask back on before a server will take your order or bring your food/drinks to the table. AMBIENCE and layout: Spacious, well ventilated back patio with warm lighting and lots of heat lamps to keep everything warm. Tables are well separated from each other, and they even have tables big enough to accomodate groups of 6 (their max currently). FOOD: Mostly modern American small eats at reasonable-for-SF-bar prices. They have sandwiches ($10 chicken po'boy looked nice, but I didn't try it), brussels sprouts and bacon, mussels, beans, etc. I had 2 fish tacos that were quite good but maybe a biiit expensive. The rest of my group got the brussels sprouts (amazing - sweet, tangy, savory) and a corn bacon pizza (I didn't try but they said it was amazing). DRINKS: Anywhere from $10-13ish for a cocktail, $9-15 for a glass of wine. There are some interesting cocktails using whiskey, tequila, mezcal, and spice. The drinks I tried were all a bit on the sweeter side. My first drink was the Otro Diablo, which is a juicy, sweet-tangy tequila mix - solid. [MISS #1] My second drink was the Salty Dog. A traditional Salty Dog is just a Greyhound (vodka or gin, with grapefruit juice) with a salt rim. Starbelly's version is gin and grapefruit, with some - too much - elderflower in there. Way too much elderflower, and the grapefruit juice isn't strong/fresh enough. The drink comes off sickly sweet and bitter without enough acid to brighten it - when I took my first sip, I said to my group ""it tastes like bathroom cleaner smells"" and they agreed it was uncanny. SERVICE: Service is fast but not particularly warm or friendly (echoing other reviews that said the same) and it's pretty easy to find someone to place more orders with. The servers gave us plenty of advance notice of the 9:15 last call and 9:45 ""time to go home"" deadlines. [MISS #2] Our main server, a taller lankier guy with curly medium length black/dark brown hair gave us off vibes the entire night. He wasn't straight up mean or discourteous, maybe impatient. There was a clear feeling he didn't want to be serving us that night.

"I came here for a friend's birthday. We had reservations for a party of six but they crammed us into a small table meant to seat four. We asked if they could push the small table next to ours to create a larger table but they weren't able to do so. I ordered the french toast which was my favorite thing off the menu and it was surprisingly filling. The pistachios gave it a nice crunch and I love the pairing of marscapone cheese. The other dishes my friends ordered looked visually appealing but didn't really wow them. Nice ambiance and the lighting was really nice during the day out in the patio seating. But I did notice that it was really loud because the patio seemed to amplify all the voices talking in the room so it was sometimes hard hearing what the person across from me was saying. In terms of spacing, I think this restaurant is more suited for smaller parties during the brunch time rush. Would be nice ambiance for a date but depends on how much you want to have conversation. Perhaps dinner time would be different?","i came here for a friend's birthday. we had reservations for a party of six but they crammed us into a small table meant to seat four. we asked if they could push the small table next to ours to create a larger table but they weren't able to do so. i ordered the french toast which was my favorite thing off the menu and it was surprisingly filling. the pistachios gave it a nice crunch and i love the pairing of marscapone cheese. the other dishes my friends ordered looked visually appealing but didn't really wow them. nice ambiance and the lighting was really nice during the day out in the patio seating. but i did notice that it was really loud because the patio seemed to amplify all the voices talking in the room so it was sometimes hard hearing what the person across from me was saying. in terms of spacing, i think this restaurant is more suited for smaller parties during the brunch time rush. would be nice ambiance for a date but depends on how much you want to have conversation. perhaps dinner time would be different?",i came here for a friends birthday we had reservations for a party of six but they crammed us into a small table meant to seat four we asked if they could push the small table next to ours to create a larger table but they werent able to do so i ordered the french toast which was my favorite thing off the menu and it was surprisingly filling the pistachios gave it a nice crunch and i love the pairing of marscapone cheese the other dishes my friends ordered looked visually appealing but didnt really wow them nice ambiance and the lighting was really nice during the day out in the patio seating but i did notice that it was really loud because the patio seemed to amplify all the voices talking in the room so it was sometimes hard hearing what the person across from me was saying in terms of spacing i think this restaurant is more suited for smaller parties during the brunch time rush would be nice ambiance for a date but depends on how much you want to have conversation perhaps dinner time would be different,came friends birthday reservations party six crammed us small table meant seat four asked could push small table next create larger table werent able ordered french toast favorite thing menu surprisingly filling pistachios gave nice crunch love pairing marscapone cheese dishes friends ordered looked visually appealing didnt really wow nice ambiance lighting really nice day patio seating notice really loud patio seemed amplify voices talking room sometimes hard hearing person across saying terms spacing think restaurant suited smaller parties brunch time rush would nice ambiance date depends much want conversation perhaps dinner time would different,friends birthday reservations party six crammed small table meant seat four asked could push small table next create larger table werent able ordered french toast favorite thing menu surprisingly filling pistachios gave nice crunch love pairing marscapone cheese dishes friends ordered looked visually appealing didnt really wow nice ambiance lighting really nice day patio seating notice really loud patio seemed amplify voices talking room sometimes hard hearing person across saying terms spacing think restaurant suited smaller parties brunch time rush nice ambiance date depends much want conversation perhaps dinner time different,friend birthday reservation party six crammed small table meant seat four asked could push small table next create larger table werent able ordered french toast favorite thing menu surprisingly filling pistachio gave nice crunch love pairing marscapone cheese dish friend ordered looked visually appealing didnt really wow nice ambiance lighting really nice day patio seating notice really loud patio seemed amplify voice talking room sometimes hard hearing person across saying term spacing think restaurant suited smaller party brunch time rush nice ambiance date depends much want conversation perhaps dinner time different,0.23541666666666666,0.6083333333333332

"Starbelly's restaurant week menu for lunch is such a steal! Getting a great 3-course meal for $15 in San Francisco is something that is pretty hard to find, but Starbelly executes it very well! After going to Restaurant Week places for a couple years in SF, San Jose, and Oakland, I have to say that Starbelly was one of the most worth for the price. The inside of the restaurant was very nice and cozy, with the colored stars in the patio area adding a nice touch. The service was good and I have no complaints there. Now onto the food:1st Course: We got the house made chicken liver pâté, which was a dish that I haven't had since I went to France over 3 years ago. This dish was delicious, and the liver pâté was very buttery and creamy. It definitely paired really well with the mustard and jam that was offered with it on the bread.2nd Course: For this course, we both got the fried chicken po'boy which was a good amount of food. This came with a jalapeno and radicchio slaw that added some flavor to the sandwich. Although the fried chicken wasn't amazing, it was still pretty good and definitely was filling.3rd Course: Now for dessert! The salted caramel pot de crème was delicious, and I greatly enjoyed it. It was honestly one of the best caramel dishes I've had so far, and wasn't overly sweet or salty in its flavor. Definitely would get again!Overall the meal was great, and for $15 during restaurant week it is absolutely is one of the best deals I've seen around the city! I definitely will be coming back here again and recommend it highly for anyone!","starbelly's restaurant week menu for lunch is such a steal! getting a great 3-course meal for $15 in san francisco is something that is pretty hard to find, but starbelly executes it very well!

"This was my first time going to Starbelly for dinner and, overall, it was not an enjoyable meal. The food was poorly prepared and executed, and service was inattentive. To start with service, after we sat down our server came to the table at the start saying ""I'm here for anything you need"" but then very quickly left without offering water or checking if we had any questions. We laughed about it with a couple sitting next to us because it was so contradictory, but the inattentiveness was consistent throughout the duration of our meal. As for food, to start, the water jug we received tasted really strange, like they had filled part of it with sparkling and part of it with still. For appetizers, we got the goat cheese dumplings and grilled octopus. The dumplings were fine but the octopus was undercooked and the overall flavors of the dish were completely off. For our main dish, we ordered the roasted corn pizza but were served the margherita pizza instead. While we were able to return the pizza for the one we ordered, at that point, I was already disappointed in the dinner experience as a whole. I'll give their brunch a try next time but won't be returning for dinner anytime soon.","this was my first time going to starbelly for dinner and, overall, it was not an enjoyable meal. the food was poorly prepared and executed, and service was inattentive. to start with service, after we sat down our server came to the table at the start saying ""i'm here for anything you need"" but then very quickly left without offering water or checking if we had any questions. we laughed about it with a couple sitting next to us because it was so contradictory, but the inattentiveness was consistent throughout the duration of our meal. as for food, to start, the water jug we received tasted really strange, like they had filled part of it with sparkling and part of it with still. for appetizers, we got the goat cheese dumplings and grilled octopus. the dumplings were fine but the octopus was undercooked and the overall flavors of the dish were completely off. for our main dish, we ordered the roasted corn pizza but were served the margherita pizza instead. while we were able to return the pizza for the one we ordered, at that point, i was already disappointed in the dinner experience as a whole. i'll give their brunch a try next time but won't be returning for dinner anytime soon.",this was my first time going to starbelly for dinner and overall it was not an enjoyable meal the food was poorly prepared and executed and service was inattentive to start with service after we sat down our server came to the table at the start saying im here for anything you need but then very quickly left without offering water or checking if we had any questions we laughed about it with a couple sitting next to us because it was so contradictory but the inattentiveness was consistent throughout the duration of our meal as for food to start the water jug we received tasted really strange like they had filled part of it with sparkling and part of it with still for appetizers we got the goat cheese dumplings and grilled octopus the dumplings were fine but the octopus was undercooked and the overall flavors of the dish were completely off for our main dish we ordered the roasted corn pizza but were served the margherita pizza instead while we were able to return the pizza for the one we ordered at that point i was already disappointed in the dinner experience as a whole ill give their brunch a try next time but wont be returning for dinner anytime soon,first time going starbelly dinner overall enjoyable meal food poorly prepared executed service inattentive start service sat server came table start saying im anything need quickly left without offering water checking questions laughed couple sitting next us contradictory inattentiveness consistent throughout duration meal food start water jug received tasted really strange like filled part sparkling part still appetizers got goat cheese dumplings grilled octopus dumplings fine octopus undercooked overall flavors dish completely main dish ordered roasted corn pizza served margherita pizza instead able return pizza one ordered point already disappointed dinner experience whole ill give brunch try next time wont returning dinner anytime soon,first time going starbelly dinner overall enjoyable meal food poorly prepared executed service inattentive start service sat server table start saying anything need quickly left without offering water checking questions laughed couple sitting next contradictory inattentiveness consistent throughout duration meal food start water jug received tasted really strange like filled part sparkling part still appetizers goat cheese dumplings grilled octopus dumplings fine octopus undercooked overall flavors dish completely main dish ordered roasted corn pizza served margherita pizza instead able return pizza ordered point already disappointed dinner experience whole ill give brunch next time wont returning dinner anytime soon,first time going starbelly dinner overall enjoyable meal food poorly prepared executed service inattentive start service sat server table start saying anything need quickly left without offering water checking question laughed couple sitting next contradictory inattentiveness consistent throughout duration meal food start water jug received tasted really strange like filled part sparkling part still appetizer goat cheese dumpling grilled octopus dumpling fine octopus undercooked overall flavor dish completely main dish ordered roasted corn pizza served margherita pizza instead able return pizza ordered point already disappointed dinner experience whole ill give brunch next time wont returning dinner anytime soon,0.0935185185185185,0.3689814814814815

"I want to like this restaurant and have tried it many times as it has one of the nicest outdoor dining patios in the area and very nice staff.  I have found the food to be okay, if not extremely inspired.  After my last visit I don't think I will be back the mediocre food is not worth it. I am not sure if they have a new chef? The Fritto misto was made with corn meal and very hard.  The French fries were good, but the sauces underwhelming.  The meatballs were the most overcooked and dried out things I have ever eaten and the kale salad was terrible.  The pizza margarita was the best thing we tried, but even that will not make it worth revisiting.","i want to like this restaurant and have tried it many times as it has one of the nicest outdoor dining patios in the area and very nice staff. i have found the food to be okay, if not extremely inspired. after my last visit i don't think i will be back the mediocre food is not worth it. i am not sure if they have a new chef? the fritto misto was made with corn meal and very hard. the french fries were good, but the sauces underwhelming. the meatballs were the most overcooked and dried out things i have ever eaten and the kale salad was terrible. the pizza margarita was the best thing we tried, but even that will not make it worth revisiting.",i want to like this restaurant and have tried it many times as it has one of the nicest outdoor dining patios in the area and very nice staff i have found the food to be okay if not extremely inspired after my last visit i dont think i will be back the mediocre food is not worth it i am not sure if they have a new chef the fritto misto was made with corn meal and very hard the french fries were good but the sauces underwhelming the meatballs were the most overcooked and dried out things i have ever eaten and the kale salad was terrible the pizza margarita was the best thing we tried but even that will not make it worth revisiting,want like restaurant tried many times one nicest outdoor dining patios area nice staff found food okay extremely inspired last visit dont think back mediocre food worth sure new chef fritto misto made corn meal hard french fries good sauces underwhelming meatballs overcooked dried things ever eaten kale salad terrible pizza margarita best thing tried even make worth revisiting,want like restaurant tried many times nicest outdoor dining patios area nice staff found food okay extremely inspired last visit dont think back mediocre food worth sure new chef fritto misto made corn meal hard french fries good sauces underwhelming meatballs overcooked dried things ever eaten kale salad terrible pizza margarita best thing tried even make worth revisiting,want like restaurant tried many time nicest outdoor dining patio area nice staff found food okay extremely inspired last visit dont think back mediocre food worth sure new chef fritto misto made corn meal hard french fry good sauce underwhelming meatball overcooked dried thing ever eaten kale salad terrible pizza margarita best thing tried even make worth revisiting,0.14233511586452763,0.5089275103980986

"I came here with a friend recently, due to his suggestion. I guess when you grab food and drinks with a queer couple, the Castro is a must. =) Not complaining at all!Thankfully, they wanted to share foods so I got a variety of tastes. My friend upsold the pate, insisting we had to get it and that it was delicious. I was worried, because when people gush about something it often leads to failure. This. DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The pate is soooo BOMB. Get it. We had a mix of stuff so the quick and dirty.Persimmon salad: Fresh, properly dressed, and delicious.Brussels: A little oily but flavorful and crispy. Pizza: Just solid. Not special, but if you want a pizza here it'll do.Steak: Nicely cooked, nicely seasoned. Somehow a giant order of fries appeared at our table too. And the sauces were delicious. Utterly delicious. What brings it to a 4 rather than a 5 for me. The service was good overall, their manager got his hands dirty and helped serve our table as well.  But they were very clear that we had to leave by 8 because of a reservation. We didn't mind...but then they sat a table of 2 next to us at the communal table and those guys said they were not a reservation of more. So...why did they hurry us out? It felt really weird. Don't take it as a total negative though. I'm sure if I made a reservation and came here again, everything would feel and taste 100% how amazing restaurants are and should be. This place is awesome and you should definitely try.","i came here with a friend recently, due to his suggestion. i guess when you grab food and drinks with a queer couple, the castro is a must. =) not complaining at all!thankfully, they wanted to share foods so i got a variety of tastes. my friend upsold the pate, insisting we had to get it and that it was delicious. i was worried, because when people gush about something it often leads to failure. this. did not disappoint. the pate is soooo bomb. get it. we had a mix of stuff so the quick and dirty.persimmon salad: fresh, properly dressed, and delicious.brussels: a little oily but flavorful and crispy. pizza: just solid. not special, but if you want a pizza here it'll do.steak: nicely cooked, nicely seasoned. somehow a giant order of fries appeared at our table too. and the sauces were delicious. utterly delicious. what brings it to a 4 rather than a 5 for me. the service was good overall, their manager got his hands dirty and helped serve our table as well. but they were very clear that we had to leave by 8 because of a reservation. we didn't mind...but then they sat a table of 2 next to us at the communal table and those guys said they were not a reservation of more. so...why did they hurry us out?

We did not ask about dessert. The foods was 2/3 enchanting. Corn soup, delicious. Fried chicken po' boy light crispy and delicious with a mild jalapeño slaw. The problem was the salad.

"Came here around 10:30am on a Sunday. It wasn't super busy- but since we didn't make a reservation we could only sit outside or at the bar. We chose outside since they said they turned on the heaters, but I still thought it was cold. We shared the Sunnyside Joe's ($13)- which was ground beer, cheddar, spinach, and potatoes. I absolutely LOVED the potatoes. They were so crispy and delicious- I wish there were a few more. The eggs were definitely way over cooked- there was no drippy yolk and the beef didn't have a ton of flavor, but with the cheese it tasted better.We also got the Challah French Toast ($14)- It came with mascarpone, peaches, and pistachios. This was soooo good, I loved the combination! While it was a bit dry around the edges, the middle was quite yummy and not overly sweet. Presentation was also beautiful. It nicely complemented the savoriness of the other dish. I didn't think it was going to be enough food for the two of us, but after we were finished, we were definitely comfortably full. The service was a bit slow and it took a bit longer to get our food (I think they forgot about us outside!).","came here around 10:30am on a sunday. it wasn't super busy- but since we didn't make a reservation we could only sit outside or at the bar. we chose outside since they said they turned on the heaters, but i still thought it was cold. we shared the sunnyside joe's ($13)- which was ground beer, cheddar, spinach, and potatoes. i absolutely loved the potatoes. they were so crispy and delicious- i wish there were a few more. the eggs were definitely way over cooked- there was no drippy yolk and the beef didn't have a ton of flavor, but with the cheese it tasted better.we also got the challah french toast ($14)- it came with mascarpone, peaches, and pistachios. this was soooo good, i loved the combination! while it was a bit dry around the edges, the middle was quite yummy and not overly sweet. presentation was also beautiful. it nicely complemented the savoriness of the other dish. i didn't think it was going to be enough food for the two of us, but after we were finished, we were definitely comfortably full. the service was a bit slow and it took a bit longer to get our food (i think they forgot about us outside!).",came here around 1030am on a sunday it wasnt super busy but since we didnt make a reservation we could only sit outside or at the bar we chose outside since they said they turned on the heaters but i still thought it was cold we shared the sunnyside joes 13 which was ground beer cheddar spinach and potatoes i absolutely loved the potatoes they were so crispy and delicious i wish there were a few more the eggs were definitely way over cooked there was no drippy yolk and the beef didnt have a ton of flavor but with the cheese it tasted betterwe also got the challah french toast 14 it came with mascarpone peaches and pistachios this was soooo good i loved the combination while it was a bit dry around the edges the middle was quite yummy and not overly sweet presentation was also beautiful it nicely complemented the savoriness of the other dish i didnt think it was going to be enough food for the two of us but after we were finished we were definitely comfortably full the service was a bit slow and it took a bit longer to get our food i think they forgot about us outside,came around 1030am sunday wasnt super busy since didnt make reservation could sit outside bar chose outside since said turned heaters still thought cold shared sunnyside joes 13 ground beer cheddar spinach potatoes absolutely loved potatoes crispy delicious wish eggs definitely way cooked drippy yolk beef didnt ton flavor cheese tasted betterwe also got challah french toast 14 came mascarpone peaches pistachios soooo good loved combination bit dry around edges middle quite yummy overly sweet presentation also beautiful nicely complemented savoriness dish didnt think going enough food two us finished definitely comfortably full service bit slow took bit longer get food think forgot us outside,around 1030am sunday wasnt super busy since didnt make reservation could sit outside bar chose outside since said turned heaters still thought cold shared sunnyside joes 13 ground beer cheddar spinach potatoes absolutely loved potatoes crispy delicious wish eggs definitely way cooked drippy yolk beef didnt ton flavor cheese tasted betterwe also challah french toast 14 mascarpone peaches pistachios soooo good loved combination bit dry around edges middle quite yummy overly sweet presentation also beautiful nicely complemented savoriness dish didnt think going enough food two finished definitely comfortably full service bit slow took bit longer food think forgot outside,around 1030am sunday wasnt super busy since didnt make reservation could sit outside bar chose outside since said turned heater still thought cold shared sunnyside joes 13 ground beer cheddar spinach potato absolutely loved potato crispy delicious wish egg definitely way cooked drippy yolk beef didnt ton flavor cheese tasted betterwe also challah french toast 14 mascarpone peach pistachio soooo good loved combination bit dry around edge middle quite yummy overly sweet presentation also beautiful nicely complemented savoriness dish didnt think going enough food two finished definitely comfortably full service bit slow took bit longer food think forgot outside,0.23583333333333334,0.5258333333333334

"I really enjoyed my meal here. My friend who lives in SF picked it up on her way to visit so I had to warm up by the time she got here, which was to be expected (I now really appreciate eating food in-person so much more). I went w/the french toast and fried chicken combo. I hadn't had either in such a long time, so decided to go w/that as my entree. I was not let down--really buttery french toast (I should have asked for more syrup, you only get a small container on the side) and crispy on the outside/juicy on the inside fried chicken. Decent sized portion for a takeout item too. I would definitely like to try the other dishes and cocktails whenever I can actually make it into this establishment.","i really enjoyed my meal here. my friend who lives in sf picked it up on her way to visit so i had to warm up by the time she got here, which was to be expected (i now really appreciate eating food in-person so much more). i went w/the french toast and fried chicken combo. i hadn't had either in such a long time, so decided to go w/that as my entree. i was not let down--really buttery french toast (i should have asked for more syrup, you only get a small container on the side) and crispy on the outside/juicy on the inside fried chicken. decent sized portion for a takeout item too. i would definitely like to try the other dishes and cocktails whenever i can actually make it into this establishment.",i really enjoyed my meal here my friend who lives in sf picked it up on her way to visit so i had to warm up by the time she got here which was to be expected i now really appreciate eating food inperson so much more i went wthe french toast and fried chicken combo i hadnt had either in such a long time so decided to go wthat as my entree i was not let downreally buttery french toast i should have asked for more syrup you only get a small container on the side and crispy on the outsidejuicy on the inside fried chicken decent sized portion for a takeout item too i would definitely like to try the other dishes and cocktails whenever i can actually make it into this establishment,really enjoyed meal friend lives sf picked way visit warm time got expected really appreciate eating food inperson much went wthe french toast fried chicken combo hadnt either long time decided go wthat entree let downreally buttery french toast asked syrup get small container side crispy outsidejuicy inside fried chicken decent sized portion takeout item would definitely like try dishes cocktails whenever actually make establishment,really enjoyed meal friend lives sf picked way visit warm time expected really appreciate eating food inperson much went wthe french toast fried chicken combo hadnt either long time decided wthat entree let downreally buttery french toast asked syrup small container side crispy outsidejuicy inside fried chicken decent sized portion takeout item definitely like dishes cocktails whenever actually make establishment,really enjoyed meal friend life sf picked way visit warm time expected really appreciate eating food inperson much went wthe french toast fried chicken combo hadnt either long time decided wthat entree let downreally buttery french toast asked syrup small container side crispy outsidejuicy inside fried chicken decent sized portion takeout item definitely like dish cocktail whenever actually make establishment,0.0047619047619047545,0.4333333333333333
"This was my second time at Starbelly. I don't really remember my first time (it was a larger dinner party), so this review is based off my recent experience. We came here on a Saturday at around 3PM. There was 6 of us, and we loved everything about our meal. We ordered drinks, and we all loved our drinks! Our server even gave my girl a tequila shot (we were brunching after wedding dress shopping).As for the meal, every thing was excellent! We had:Brussel sprouts- 5/5 this was sooo good. Crispy and sweet. We didn't realize it had bacon, so my vegetarian friend couldn't eat this. But for a meat eater, these brussels were perfect! Elote pizza- 4.5/5 I loved this! We ordered 3 pizzas, and only ate 2. They are massive, I would definitely share this among 2-3 people. Loved the sweet corn, and the sauce on top was sooo good. Tasted like some kind of aioliFries-5/5 these tasted like those double fried fries they have in Belgium. Soooo crispy and the sauces were good. I think it was pesto aioli, house made ketchup, and chipotle sauce. All of them were good, but I loved the pesto! Butternut squash ravioli- 5/5 this was my favorite thing I had! It was cooked in brown butter & fried sage. Sooooo flavorful. The raviolis themselves almost tasted like dumplings. I loved the textureChicken pate- 3.5/5 this was my first time having pate. I don't know what good pate is, but I wasn't the hugest fan. I did like the grilled bread tho, it was blackened and delicious.

"A decent experience for dinner. Everything we tried, whether the little gems, the chorizo pizza, or the fried chicken, was OK enough, although not necessarily mind-blowing. Just OK. The fried chicken, in particular, was a tad too fried.Perhaps the strongest point was the service; the staff were generally attentive, courteous, and professional. The venue itself is also larger than it appears at first glance thanks to a nice outdoor patio in the rear with a sturdy-enough tarp to hold up well even on a particularly rainy and windy day recently. Not a bad choice overall.","a decent experience for dinner. everything we tried, whether the little gems, the chorizo pizza, or the fried chicken, was ok enough, although not necessarily mind-blowing. just ok. the fried chicken, in particular, was a tad too fried.perhaps the strongest point was the service; the staff were generally attentive, courteous, and professional. the venue itself is also larger than it appears at first glance thanks to a nice outdoor patio in the rear with a sturdy-enough tarp to hold up well even on a particularly rainy and windy day recently. not a bad choice overall.",a decent experience for dinner everything we tried whether the little gems the chorizo pizza or the fried chicken was ok enough although not necessarily mindblowing just ok the fried chicken in particular was a tad too friedperhaps the strongest point was the service the staff were generally attentive courteous and professional the venue itself is also larger than it appears at first glance thanks to a nice outdoor patio in the rear with a sturdyenough tarp to hold up well even on a particularly rainy and windy day recently not a bad choice overall,decent experience dinner everything tried whether little gems chorizo pizza fried chicken ok enough although necessarily mindblowing ok fried chicken particular tad friedperhaps strongest point service staff generally attentive courteous professional venue also larger appears first glance thanks nice outdoor patio rear sturdyenough tarp hold well even particularly rainy windy day recently bad choice overall,decent experience dinner everything tried whether little gems chorizo pizza fried chicken ok enough although necessarily mindblowing ok fried chicken particular tad friedperhaps strongest point service staff generally attentive courteous professional venue also larger appears first glance thanks nice outdoor patio rear sturdyenough tarp hold well even particularly rainy windy day recently bad choice overall,decent experience dinner everything tried whether little gem chorizo pizza fried chicken ok enough although necessarily mindblowing ok fried chicken particular tad friedperhaps strongest point service staff generally attentive courteous professional venue also larger appears first glance thanks nice outdoor patio rear sturdyenough tarp hold well even particularly rainy windy day recently bad choice overall,0.08223684210526316,0.575438596491228
"I was really excited to come back to Starbelly, but was disappointed during this most recent visit. I think the food was 3.5 stars but with the lackluster service I'm giving it 3 stars. Hoping it was just an off night for them. The charbroiled mussels looked visually spectacular but the mussels were not fresh at all, to the point where they weren't pleasant to eat and we left the plate unfinished. It's probably the only time in my life I didn't finish a plate of mussels as appetizers.The Grilled Bavette steak was rubbery. It's a cut of flank steak so I was expecting it to be tougher, but not to this extent. It was also flavorless, which I wasn't expecting. The vegetables with this dish lacked any flavor. Chicken Liver Pate saved the day, and as other reviews have indicated, simply incredible. Great flavor and just delicious with the marmalade and mustard over bread.Starbelly bacon pizza. Pretty solid. Bacon was really good. The tomato sauce is excellent.","i was really excited to come back to starbelly, but was disappointed during this most recent visit. i think the food was 3.5 stars but with the lackluster service i'm giving it 3 stars. hoping it was just an off night for them. the charbroiled mussels looked visually spectacular but the mussels were not fresh at all, to the point where they weren't pleasant to eat and we left the plate unfinished. it's probably the only time in my life i didn't finish a plate of mussels as appetizers.the grilled bavette steak was rubbery. it's a cut of flank steak so i was expecting it to be tougher, but not to this extent. it was also flavorless, which i wasn't expecting. the vegetables with this dish lacked any flavor. chicken liver pate saved the day, and as other reviews have indicated, simply incredible. great flavor and just delicious with the marmalade and mustard over bread.starbelly bacon pizza. pretty solid. bacon was really good. the tomato sauce is excellent.",i was really excited to come back to starbelly but was disappointed during this most recent visit i think the food was 35 stars but with the lackluster service im giving it 3 stars hoping it was just an off night for them the charbroiled mussels looked visually spectacular but the mussels were not fresh at all to the point where they werent pleasant to eat and we left the plate unfinished its probably the only time in my life i didnt finish a plate of mussels as appetizersthe grilled bavette steak was rubbery its a cut of flank steak so i was expecting it to be tougher but not to this extent it was also flavorless which i wasnt expecting the vegetables with this dish lacked any flavor chicken liver pate saved the day and as other reviews have indicated simply incredible great flavor and just delicious with the marmalade and mustard over breadstarbelly bacon pizza pretty solid bacon was really good the tomato sauce is excellent,really excited come back starbelly disappointed recent visit think food 35 stars lackluster service im giving 3 stars hoping night charbroiled mussels looked visually spectacular mussels fresh point werent pleasant eat left plate unfinished probably time life didnt finish plate mussels appetizersthe grilled bavette steak rubbery cut flank steak expecting tougher extent also flavorless wasnt expecting vegetables dish lacked flavor chicken liver pate saved day reviews indicated simply incredible great flavor delicious marmalade mustard breadstarbelly bacon pizza pretty solid bacon really good tomato sauce excellent,really excited come back starbelly disappointed recent visit think food 35 stars lackluster service giving 3 stars hoping night charbroiled mussels looked visually spectacular mussels fresh point werent pleasant eat left plate unfinished probably time life didnt finish plate mussels appetizersthe grilled bavette steak rubbery cut flank steak expecting tougher extent also flavorless wasnt expecting vegetables dish lacked flavor chicken liver pate saved day reviews indicated simply incredible great flavor delicious marmalade mustard breadstarbelly bacon pizza pretty solid bacon really good tomato sauce excellent,really excited come back starbelly disappointed recent visit think food 35 star lackluster service giving 3 star hoping night charbroiled mussel looked visually spectacular mussel fresh point werent pleasant eat left plate unfinished probably time life didnt finish plate mussel appetizersthe grilled bavette steak rubbery cut flank steak expecting tougher extent also flavorless wasnt expecting vegetable dish lacked flavor chicken liver pate saved day review indicated simply incredible great flavor delicious marmalade mustard breadstarbelly bacon pizza pretty solid bacon really good tomato sauce excellent,0.33177083333333335,0.6510416666666666

"Oh Starbelly;  how my belly wasn't full, nor did I think this was a 4 star experience.Started off with the fresh and super bitter orange juice. Skip it.Pizza was so bland, and had so little cheese I thought maybe they thought we were lactose intolerant. I mean, a Margarita pizza is supposed to have cheesy goodness--not bland crust and dry sauce.The mushroom pizza was only slightly better,  only because it had mushrooms, but once again it was lacking cheese and sauce.The next meal was catfish which was so ""blackened"" no one ate it. Dry and burnt, but sure, call it blackened if you want.The steak was chewy, and the desserts were plain. The butterscotch pudding also had a weird flavor to it so no one took another bite and the Chocolate cake was dry and cold.For our Christmas work dinner,  this place was a disappointment.","oh starbelly; how my belly wasn't full, nor did i think this was a 4 star experience.started off with the fresh and super bitter orange juice. skip it.pizza was so bland, and had so little cheese i thought maybe they thought we were lactose intolerant. i mean, a margarita pizza is supposed to have cheesy goodness--not bland crust and dry sauce.the mushroom pizza was only slightly better, only because it had mushrooms, but once again it was lacking cheese and sauce.the next meal was catfish which was so ""blackened"" no one ate it. dry and burnt, but sure, call it blackened if you want.the steak was chewy, and the desserts were plain. the butterscotch pudding also had a weird flavor to it so no one took another bite and the chocolate cake was dry and cold.for our christmas work dinner, this place was a disappointment.",oh starbelly how my belly wasnt full nor did i think this was a 4 star experiencestarted off with the fresh and super bitter orange juice skip itpizza was so bland and had so little cheese i thought maybe they thought we were lactose intolerant i mean a margarita pizza is supposed to have cheesy goodnessnot bland crust and dry saucethe mushroom pizza was only slightly better only because it had mushrooms but once again it was lacking cheese and saucethe next meal was catfish which was so blackened no one ate it dry and burnt but sure call it blackened if you wantthe steak was chewy and the desserts were plain the butterscotch pudding also had a weird flavor to it so no one took another bite and the chocolate cake was dry and coldfor our christmas work dinner this place was a disappointment,oh starbelly belly wasnt full think 4 star experiencestarted fresh super bitter orange juice skip itpizza bland little cheese thought maybe thought lactose intolerant mean margarita pizza supposed cheesy goodnessnot bland crust dry saucethe mushroom pizza slightly better mushrooms lacking cheese saucethe next meal catfish blackened one ate dry burnt sure call blackened wantthe steak chewy desserts plain butterscotch pudding also weird flavor one took another bite chocolate cake dry coldfor christmas work dinner place disappointment,oh starbelly belly wasnt full think 4 star experiencestarted fresh super bitter orange juice skip itpizza bland little cheese thought maybe thought lactose intolerant mean margarita pizza supposed cheesy goodnessnot bland crust dry saucethe mushroom pizza slightly better mushrooms lacking cheese saucethe next meal catfish blackened ate dry burnt sure call blackened wantthe steak chewy desserts plain butterscotch pudding also weird flavor took another bite chocolate cake dry coldfor christmas work dinner place disappointment,oh starbelly belly wasnt full think 4 star experiencestarted fresh super bitter orange juice skip itpizza bland little cheese thought maybe thought lactose intolerant mean margarita pizza supposed cheesy goodnessnot bland crust dry saucethe mushroom pizza slightly better mushroom lacking cheese saucethe next meal catfish blackened ate dry burnt sure call blackened wantthe steak chewy dessert plain butterscotch pudding also weird flavor took another bite chocolate cake dry coldfor christmas work dinner place disappointment,-0.053571428571428575,0.6120480599647267

"Was a little disappointed for a few reasons but one in particular. We booked reservations for restaurant week and while other restaurants seem to honor the menus weekday and weekend, this place didn't (which isn't a bad thing), but it also didn't note it on the restaurant week site and we booked our reservations through there. What was supposed to be a really good deal for lunch $15 ended up being way more for way less since we had try things off the regular brunch menu. We were told when we got there and apparently a few others around us ran into the same issue. Anyway,Ordered:-chilaquiles which was tasty however there were so many jalapeños (not spicy) but I didn't order a jalapeño chilaquiles and that seemed to be the primary ingredient after the chips. -chicken sandwich that was on restaurant week menu but $10 on its own.  The chicken was a bit dry to be honest and really thin. One side/edge of it was completely crunch batter without much chicken -the mushroom pizza we substituted white sauce with red and was asked if we wanted arugula. We shouldn't have made the assumption but it sounded like it was included but they charge $2 for it. Overall pizza was okay. Mushrooms were good and gruyere cheese added a nice kick but the pizza was soggy I couldn't lift it up form the crust side without all the toppings sliding off. Restaurant ambiance is nice and cute though with indoor, outdoor, and communal tables.","was a little disappointed for a few reasons but one in particular. we booked reservations for restaurant week

"(3.5 stars) Perfect spot for dinner with some friends. The back patio is wonderfully cozy with heat lamps, plenty of space, and peaceful decor. The food is very solid aside from the French fries which were disappointingly thin and unseasoned, though the sauces were a unique twist--with the green one being the standout. Loved the broccolini and the white bean dip, both great for sharing. Struggled to choose a main but landed on the chorizo and egg pizza. I normally love a runny egg on anything, but it actually was a bit overwhelming here since each egg landed on its own slice. The chorizo had some kick to it though and went really nicely on its own with the cheese and thick crust.","(3.5 stars) perfect spot for dinner with some friends. the back patio is wonderfully cozy with heat lamps, plenty of space, and peaceful decor. the food is very solid aside from the french fries which were disappointingly thin and unseasoned, though the sauces were a unique twist--with the green one being the standout. loved the broccolini and the white bean dip, both great for sharing. struggled to choose a main but landed on the chorizo and egg pizza. i normally love a runny egg on anything, but it actually was a bit overwhelming here since each egg landed on its own slice. the chorizo had some kick to it though and went really nicely on its own with the cheese and thick crust.",35 stars perfect spot for dinner with some friends the back patio is wonderfully cozy with heat lamps plenty of space and peaceful decor the food is very solid aside from the french fries which were disappointingly thin and unseasoned though the sauces were a unique twistwith the green one being the standout loved the broccolini and the white bean dip both great for sharing struggled to choose a main but landed on the chorizo and egg pizza i normally love a runny egg on anything but it actually was a bit overwhelming here since each egg landed on its own slice the chorizo had some kick to it though and went really nicely on its own with the cheese and thick crust,35 stars perfect spot dinner friends back patio wonderfully cozy heat lamps plenty space peaceful decor food solid aside french fries disappointingly thin unseasoned though sauces unique twistwith green one standout loved broccolini white bean dip great sharing struggled choose main landed chorizo egg pizza normally love runny egg anything actually bit overwhelming since egg landed slice chorizo kick though went really nicely cheese thick crust,35 stars perfect spot dinner friends back patio wonderfully cozy heat lamps plenty space peaceful decor food solid aside french fries disappointingly thin unseasoned though sauces unique twistwith green standout loved broccolini white bean dip great sharing struggled choose main landed chorizo egg pizza normally love runny egg anything actually bit overwhelming since egg landed slice chorizo kick though went really nicely cheese thick crust,35 star perfect spot dinner friend back patio wonderfully cozy heat lamp plenty space peaceful decor food solid aside french fry disappointingly thin unseasoned though sauce unique twistwith green standout loved broccolini white bean dip great sharing struggled choose main landed chorizo egg pizza normally love runny egg anything actually bit overwhelming since egg landed slice chorizo kick though went really nicely cheese thick crust,0.21064814814814817,0.5310185185185184

"Starbelly has been doing restaurant week for awhile now but is only doing M-F for spring 2022.  We came on a weekend brunch around 1pm on Saturday the place was packed but not full.  We ordered Italian Eggs and Sunnyside Joes per the server's recommendation.  Both dishes were great, not huge portion but the food filled me up.  Because it is comfort food, the food is a little more on the oily and saltier side than the normal yogurt and salads.  The price is good for the location and what you get, I would definitely recommend this place.","starbelly has been doing restaurant week for awhile now but is only doing m-f for spring 2022. we came on a weekend brunch around 1pm on saturday the place was packed but not full. we ordered italian eggs and sunnyside joes per the server's recommendation. both dishes were great, not huge portion but the food filled me up. because it is comfort food, the food is a little more on the oily and saltier side than the normal yogurt and salads. the price is good for the location and what you get, i would definitely recommend this place.",starbelly has been doing restaurant week for awhile now but is only doing mf for spring 2022 we came on a weekend brunch around 1pm on saturday the place was packed but not full we ordered italian eggs and sunnyside joes per the servers recommendation both dishes were great not huge portion but the food filled me up because it is comfort food the food is a little more on the oily and saltier side than the normal yogurt and salads the price is good for the location and what you get i would definitely recommend this place,starbelly restaurant week awhile mf spring 2022 came weekend brunch around 1pm saturday place packed full ordered italian eggs sunnyside joes per servers recommendation dishes great huge portion food filled comfort food food little oily saltier side normal yogurt salads price good location get would definitely recommend place,starbelly restaurant week awhile mf spring 2022 weekend brunch around 1pm saturday place packed full ordered italian eggs sunnyside joes per servers recommendation dishes great huge portion food filled comfort food food little oily saltier side normal yogurt salads price good location definitely recommend place,starbelly restaurant week awhile mf spring 2022 weekend brunch around 1pm saturday place packed full ordered italian egg sunnyside joes per server recommendation dish great huge portion food filled comfort food food little oily saltier side normal yogurt salad price good location definitely recommend place,0.29027777777777775,0.5944444444444444
"This place used to be good many moons ago, but sadly it's slipped way down. Starbelly was sort of hanging on even before Covid where the food was just OK and the service was underwhelming. One would think after being forced to close and revamp after a pandemic that a business would came back as a shooting star and grateful to be making money again. Nope! Still mediocre food and horrendous service that's not fit for roadside diner. Doesn't seem that these ""too cool for school"" kids will get it together any time soon. Time for a change or ownership.**always get a good laugh when the establishment responds with a wannabe witty response for all to see. How about offering to make it up to the paying customers that spend their good money that pays YOUR bills Adam T? Same customers that take the time to write a post and oh gee, I don't know, offer to send them a gift card or refund? TBH why would I ever want to return to have a bunch of smug losers ""make it up"" to me? If you were such a great joint, it wouldn't have happened in the first place. It's called business 101. Perhaps an enema of the staff would be a start. And agreed Adam T. I've had some stellar service at roadside diners and some pretty bottom of the barrel terrible service too and what I experienced at Starbelly was worse than any of those.","this place used to be good many moons ago, but sadly it's slipped way down. starbelly was sort of hanging on even before covid where the food was just ok and the service was underwhelming. one would think after being forced to close and revamp after a pandemic that a business would came back as a shooting star and grateful to be making money again. nope! still mediocre food and horrendous service that's not fit for roadside diner. doesn't seem that these ""too cool for school"" kids will get it together any time soon. time for a change or ownership.**always get a good laugh when the establishment responds with a wannabe witty response for all to see. how about offering to make it up to the paying customers that spend their good money that pays your bills adam t?

"Came here this previous Sunday for brunch.

And requested for the patio outside.The patio is gorgeous and has an open top, but gets enclosed when it rains which there was a chance that it would, but it was still bright and cheery out there. The food was great. And I would highly recommend my dish:chilaquiles, house made chorizo, corn chips, chile sauce, cilantro cilantro, guacamole & house salad ^ only complaint is there wasn't enough chorizo bits at all.

"Another weekend brunch restaurant checked! Starbelly is located near 16th St. Station BART/Castro so just know that parking in this area is not the best. Starbelly gets pretty packed on weekends so I would recommend making a reservation on Opentable. I made a 10AM reservation for 2 people a week in advance from when I wanted to go and I had no issues.  The place itself is super cute with nice wooden interior and a back patio area with heat lamps to keep you warm even when it's pouring outside. I got the sunnyside joes ($12) and the dish was tasty! The dish comes with some beef on the bottom mixed in with some onions, spinach, and cheddar cheese with two eggs nicely baked on top. It was a nice savory option without making me feel too guilty about what I was eating. The potatoes they had on the side were seasoned well and had a nice crisp to offset the egg portion of the dish. The only con I felt with the dish was that it got a little too runny/watery.If you want something refreshing on the side to pair with your dish the ginger/lemon soda and lavender lemonade are divine!","another weekend brunch restaurant checked! starbelly is located near 16th st. station bart/castro so just know that parking in this area is not the best. starbelly gets pretty packed on weekends so i would recommend making a reservation on opentable. i made a 10am reservation for 2 people a week in advance from when i wanted to go and i had no issues. the place itself is super cute with nice wooden interior and a back patio area with heat lamps to keep you warm even when it's pouring outside. i got the sunnyside joes ($12) and the dish was tasty! the dish comes with some beef on the bottom mixed in with some onions, spinach, and cheddar cheese with two eggs nicely baked on top. it was a nice savory option without making me feel too guilty about what i was eating. the potatoes they had on the side were seasoned well and had a nice crisp to offset the egg portion of the dish. the only con i felt with the dish was that it got a little too runny/watery.if you want something refreshing on the side to pair with your dish the ginger/lemon soda and lavender lemonade are divine!",another weekend brunch restaurant checked starbelly is located near 16th st station bartcastro so just know that parking in this area is not the best starbelly gets pretty packed on weekends so i would recommend making a reservation on opentable i made a 10am reservation for 2 people a week in advance from when i wanted to go and i had no issues the place itself is super cute with nice wooden interior and a back patio area with heat lamps to keep you warm even when its pouring outside i got the sunnyside joes 12 and the dish was tasty the dish comes with some beef on the bottom mixed in with some onions spinach and cheddar cheese with two eggs nicely baked on top it was a nice savory option without making me feel too guilty about what i was eating the potatoes they had on the side were seasoned well and had a nice crisp to offset the egg portion of the dish the only con i felt with the dish was that it got a little too runnywateryif you want something refreshing on the side to pair with your dish the gingerlemon soda and lavender lemonade are divine,another weekend brunch restaurant checked starbelly located near 16th st station bartcastro know parking area best starbelly gets pretty packed weekends would recommend making reservation opentable made 10am reservation 2 people week advance wanted go issues place super cute nice wooden interior back patio area heat lamps keep warm even pouring outside got sunnyside joes 12 dish tasty dish comes beef bottom mixed onions spinach cheddar cheese two eggs nicely baked top nice savory option without making feel guilty eating potatoes side seasoned well nice crisp offset egg portion dish con felt dish got little runnywateryif want something refreshing side pair dish gingerlemon soda lavender lemonade divine,another weekend brunch restaurant checked starbelly located near 16th st station bartcastro know parking area best starbelly gets pretty packed weekends recommend making reservation opentable made 10am reservation 2 people week advance wanted issues place super cute nice wooden interior back patio area heat lamps keep warm even pouring outside sunnyside joes 12 dish tasty dish comes beef bottom mixed onions spinach cheddar cheese two eggs nicely baked top nice savory option without making feel guilty eating potatoes side seasoned well nice crisp offset egg portion dish con felt dish little runnywateryif want something refreshing side pair dish gingerlemon soda lavender lemonade divine,another weekend brunch restaurant checked starbelly located near 16th st station bartcastro know parking area best starbelly get pretty packed weekend recommend making reservation opentable made 10am reservation 2 people week advance wanted issue place super cute nice wooden interior back patio area heat lamp keep warm even pouring outside sunnyside joes 12 dish tasty dish come beef bottom mixed onion spinach cheddar cheese two egg nicely baked top nice savory option without making feel guilty eating potato side seasoned well nice crisp offset egg portion dish con felt dish little runnywateryif want something refreshing side pair dish gingerlemon soda lavender lemonade divine,0.2997916666666667,0.5966666666666666
"When Starbelly opened its doors years ago in the Castro, people flocked here for their luscious pizza flavors and the fries with trio of dips.I definitely slacked off my yelper duties and never been here until recently for my birthday brunch. We wanted something casual and won't break the bank. We ordered several pizzas, entrees, drinks and even got charged for the cake we brought in, and each person from our group of 8 (minus me!) only spent $42 with tip. Whoa,  brunch is the way to go! From eggciting egg dishes, fresh salads, pizza, sandwiches and a few essential sides you can't live without, the brunch offerings satisfied the group. I had a delicious gazpacho style tomato soup and Italian eggs cooked in cast iron skillet with zucchini and peppers served with thick rustic bread. My friends got the chicken and waffles (so good!), challah French toast (sweet breakfast treat), Prather Ranch Burger (hefty!) and chilaquiles with House made chorizo. We ordered several pizzas and even if you get the very basic pizza margherita ($12) and add toppings like we did, you still will be in the $17-$18 range. (Screw Zero Zero where our pizza cost $25 for mediocre toppings!) the most interesting flavor combination was the roasted corn, white cheddar, Aleppo chili pizza with lime aioli, it was easily the crowd favorite! The wild mushroom pizza with pickled onions was also good. The pizza crusts are soft and pliable, although thicker than a Neapolitan style one.There were some miscommunication when the staff sliced our cake (we didn't want the whole cake sliced, but rather small portions) but they were apologetic for the mistake. Our servers were reliable and took great care of the group. As I get ""wiser"" (older? Lol) I tend to shy away from the super big, boisterous birthday parties.

"I'm at the stage of life where catching up with a few old college friends involves finding a place that can seat nine adults and six infants / toddlers - not an easy feat in SF.  My sister made the great recommendation of Starbelly.  It really lives up to its website's description as a ""casual and friendly neighborhood restaurant"".  I was easily able to make a large group reservation on the crowd-friendly covered patio.  The California comfort food cuisine made it easy to share plates, the wine and beer selection is good, and the cocktails are creative.  The bright, warm decor is as welcoming as the service.  The narrower interior would be great for smaller parties that want to avoid the chatter of the patio, but I found the noise level to be perfect: enough background noise to mask when the kids fussed but not loud enough to make conversation hard.","i'm at the stage of life where catching up with a few old college friends involves finding a place that can seat nine adults and six infants / toddlers - not an easy feat in sf. my sister made the great recommendation of starbelly. it really lives up to its website's description as a ""casual and friendly neighborhood restaurant"". i was easily able to make a large group reservation on the crowd-friendly covered patio. the california comfort food cuisine made it easy to share plates, the wine and beer selection is good, and the cocktails are creative. the bright, warm decor is as welcoming as the service. the narrower interior would be great for smaller parties that want to avoid the chatter of the patio, but i found the noise level to be perfect: enough background noise to mask when the kids fussed but not loud enough to make conversation hard.",im at the stage of life where catching up with a few old college friends involves finding a place that can seat nine adults and six infants  toddlers  not an easy feat in sf my sister made the great recommendation of starbelly it really lives up to its websites description as a casual and friendly neighborhood restaurant i was easily able to make a large group reservation on the crowdfriendly covered patio the california comfort food cuisine made it easy to share plates the wine and beer selection is good and the cocktails are creative the bright warm decor is as welcoming as the service the narrower interior would be great for smaller parties that want to avoid the chatter of the patio but i found the noise level to be perfect enough background noise to mask when the kids fussed but not loud enough to make conversation hard,im stage life catching old college friends involves finding place seat nine adults six infants toddlers easy feat sf sister made great recommendation starbelly really lives websites description casual friendly neighborhood restaurant easily able make large group reservation crowdfriendly covered patio california comfort food cuisine made easy share plates wine beer selection good cocktails creative bright warm decor welcoming service narrower interior would great smaller parties want avoid chatter patio found noise level perfect enough background noise mask kids fussed loud enough make conversation hard,stage life catching old college friends involves finding place seat nine adults six infants toddlers easy feat sf sister made great recommendation starbelly really lives websites description casual friendly neighborhood restaurant easily able make large group reservation crowdfriendly covered patio california comfort food cuisine made easy share plates wine beer selection good cocktails creative bright warm decor welcoming service narrower interior great smaller parties want avoid chatter patio found noise level perfect enough background noise mask kids fussed loud enough make conversation hard,stage life catching old college friend involves finding place seat nine adult six infant toddler easy feat sf sister made great recommendation starbelly really life website description casual friendly neighborhood restaurant easily able make large group reservation crowdfriendly covered patio california comfort food cuisine made easy share plate wine beer selection good cocktail creative bright warm decor welcoming service narrower interior great smaller party want avoid chatter patio found noise level perfect enough background noise mask kid fussed loud enough make conversation hard,0.3347402597402597,0.6376623376623377

"Really quaint little gem on 16th just off Market St and about 5 mins walk from the Castro muni.Nice hip interior, including an outside enclosed patio and a long bar with counter space to eat. A long communal table with tall chairs, kinda heavy to move but doable.  Booked this table to enjoy the 3 course lunch offered for the SF dining week, turns out it was not offered on weekends, too bad.  However, we still had a good lunch.  The chicken waffle was really good, nice crisp and flavorful $16, the loco moco $11 was simple and tasty, perfect for someone with a small appetite.  Fries with dips $7 are always good, kinda reminded of the fires in In and Out burgers. Most likely will return to try out other items on the menu.","really quaint little gem on 16th just off market st and about 5 mins walk from the castro muni.nice hip interior, including an outside enclosed patio and a long bar with counter space to eat. a long communal table with tall chairs, kinda heavy to move but doable. booked this table to enjoy the 3 course lunch offered for the sf dining week, turns out it was not offered on weekends, too bad. however, we still had a good lunch. the chicken waffle was really good, nice crisp and flavorful $16, the loco moco $11 was simple and tasty, perfect for someone with a small appetite. fries with dips $7 are always good, kinda reminded of the fires in in and out burgers. most likely will return to try out other items on the menu.",really quaint little gem on 16th just off market st and about 5 mins walk from the castro muninice hip interior including an outside enclosed patio and a long bar with counter space to eat a long communal table with tall chairs kinda heavy to move but doable booked this table to enjoy the 3 course lunch offered for the sf dining week turns out it was not offered on weekends too bad however we still had a good lunch the chicken waffle was really good nice crisp and flavorful 16 the loco moco 11 was simple and tasty perfect for someone with a small appetite fries with dips 7 are always good kinda reminded of the fires in in and out burgers most likely will return to try out other items on the menu,really quaint little gem 16th market st 5 mins walk castro muninice hip interior including outside enclosed patio long bar counter space eat long communal table tall chairs kinda heavy move doable booked table enjoy 3 course lunch offered sf dining week turns offered weekends bad however still good lunch chicken waffle really good nice crisp flavorful 16 loco moco 11 simple tasty perfect someone small appetite fries dips 7 always good kinda reminded fires burgers likely return try items menu,really quaint little gem 16th market st 5 mins walk castro muninice hip interior including outside enclosed patio long bar counter space eat long communal table tall chairs kinda heavy move doable booked table enjoy 3 course lunch offered sf dining week turns offered weekends bad however still good lunch chicken waffle really good nice crisp flavorful 16 loco moco 11 simple tasty perfect someone small appetite fries dips 7 always good kinda reminded fires burgers likely return items menu,really quaint little gem 16th market st 5 min walk castro muninice hip interior including outside enclosed patio long bar counter space eat long communal table tall chair kinda heavy move doable booked table enjoy 3 course lunch offered sf dining week turn offered weekend bad however still good lunch chicken waffle really good nice crisp flavorful 16 loco moco 11 simple tasty perfect someone small appetite fry dip 7 always good kinda reminded fire burger likely return item menu,0.13958333333333334,0.5633597883597884
"Starbelly is a cute American restaurant in Castro. I went for brunch, and the restaurant itself is cute and spins on classics. The oyster pizza (discontinued??) was not very oyster focused, more of a cheese flavor with some oyster. A good pizza, but not what I expected at all.

"Food is great, love the decor.I have been to Starbelly a handful of times, but last 2 times it was an unwelcome experience. Did not want to write a review after the 1st time, but it feels like a pattern now. Back in November, I reserved a table for 2 for my friend's birthday. We only learned about time limit once we came to the restaurant, but did not have much of a problem with an hour and a half dining. Our order was taken in a timely manner, but food took around 30 min and not the whole order arrived. The waiter forgot about our drinks, and we only got them when we had 20 min left. When he brought the drinks, we asked if we get more fries. He said it is too late, and just brought us a check. The whole experience felt so rushed and we felt uncomfortable. Today, I reserved a table for 4 for my family. We were seated at the patio, and the whole area was very empty, only one more table had people. We were set right in the spot were it was extremely windy. The wind was blowing away the warmth from the closest heater. We were asked if we could be set in any of the 4 tables by the wall or in the parklet. I am still not 100% why we could not have been moved to a different table, the waiter said those tables are ""on tab two"" (whatever that means). So we just left without ordering. The food is great, but I'm definitely not coming back.","food is great, love the decor.i have been to starbelly a handful of times, but last 2 times it was an unwelcome experience. did not want to

"Next time I'm craving great pizza in The Castro, I know where to go. Starbelly is close to all the action, yet it provides a nice escape from the hustle and bustle outside with yummy food and drinks.We both did pizza. Mine was a Margherita with burrata. The burrata felt so delicate, yet delivered so much creamy goodness. I also enjoyed the perfectly baked crust and the lovely tomato sauce on top. (My dad did a bacon and arugula pizza, and he was also very happy with his pie.)Starbelly also has a great drink list. He found a beer he was happy with, and I found a Neilson Santa Barbara Chardonnay that helped make my day. The service was a bit slow at times, but always friendly and attentive (when someone did make it to our table). I'd be very happy to return soon to try more of the menu!","next time i'm craving great pizza in the castro, i know where to go. starbelly is close to all the action, yet it provides a nice escape from the hustle and bustle outside with yummy food and drinks.we both did pizza. mine was a margherita with burrata. the burrata felt so delicate, yet delivered so much creamy goodness. i also enjoyed the perfectly baked crust and the lovely tomato sauce on top.

"Had a great dinner at Starbelly. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.The restaurant noise levels are good for a city location, and the place is very nicely designed.The food was great. We tried couple for heir pizzas and they were a great addition to the pasta with red sauce and bacon. The bacon was so good that it made us want more.We also ordered the burrata, which was good. Had a sweet sauce on it. However, it was smeared on two slices of toast, which made it expensive for what they offered. In addition, the consistency of the burrata was missed.The fries were a good finger food as we waited for the food.  The squash salad was good, grilled and placed on Kale. Very good dressing We also tried the squash wontons, very very delicious. So I would highly recommend a visit.","had a great dinner at starbelly. the staff was very accommodating and friendly.the restaurant noise levels are good for a city location, and the place is very nicely designed.the food was great. we tried couple for heir pizzas and they were a great addition to the pasta with red sauce and bacon. the bacon was so good that it made us want more.we also ordered the burrata, which was good. had a sweet sauce on it. however, it was smeared on two slices of toast, which made it expensive for what they offered. in addition, the consistency of the burrata was missed.the fries were a good finger food as we waited for the food. the squash salad was good, grilled and placed on kale. very good dressing we also tried the squash wontons, very very delicious. so i would highly recommend a visit.",had a great dinner at starbelly the staff was very accommodating and friendlythe restaurant noise levels are good for a city location and the place is very nicely designedthe food was great we tried couple for heir pizzas and they were a great addition to the pasta with red sauce and bacon the bacon was so good that it made us want morewe also ordered the burrata which was good had a sweet sauce on it however it was smeared on two slices of toast which made it expensive for what they offered in addition the consistency of the burrata was missedthe fries were a good finger food as we waited for the food the squash salad was good grilled and placed on kale very good dressing we also tried the squash wontons very very delicious so i would highly recommend a visit,great dinner starbelly staff accommodating friendlythe restaurant noise levels good city location place nicely designedthe food great tried couple heir pizzas great addition pasta red sauce bacon bacon good made us want morewe also ordered burrata good sweet sauce however smeared two slices toast made expensive offered addition consistency burrata missedthe fries good finger food waited food squash salad good grilled placed kale good dressing also tried squash wontons delicious would highly recommend visit,great dinner starbelly staff accommodating friendlythe restaurant noise levels good city location place nicely designedthe food great tried couple heir pizzas great addition pasta red sauce bacon bacon good made want morewe also ordered burrata good sweet sauce however smeared two slices toast made expensive offered addition consistency burrata missedthe fries good finger food waited food squash salad good grilled placed kale good dressing also tried squash wontons delicious highly recommend visit,great dinner starbelly staff accommodating friendlythe restaurant noise level good city location place nicely designedthe food great tried couple heir pizza great addition pasta red sauce bacon bacon good made want morewe also ordered burrata good sweet sauce however smeared two slice toast made expensive offered addition consistency burrata missedthe fry good finger food waited food squash salad good grilled placed kale good dressing also tried squash wonton delicious highly recommend visit,0.5473333333333333,0.6493333333333333

"Check out my food diary on Instagram @brittbrulee for more photosI stumbled upon this place with a friend of mine searching for an afternoon drink. This place has plenty of patio and back seat dining, everything felt self and plexi glass between other diners. The service was impeccable.

"i'm so sorry but i'm literally not a fan of this place. i'm honestly really surprised by all the good reviews. the food is extremely less than mediocre and flavorless. nothing special at all. the vibe of the place is really cute when you walk in but woo, i would not be comfortable spending money here again. i came with a friend and we got fries, liver pate, burrata, butternut squash dumplings, and the lamb meatballs. the best thing were the fries.. which like.. i'm not gonna go to a restaurant to get $7 fries yaknow? the other 2 non-ketchup dips were so strange... just not great. the butternut squash dumplings were the next best.. still wouldn't say i liked them tho. there wasn't a ton of flavor but i did like the touch of the pumpkin seeds and the sauce. the liver pate, burrata and lamb meatballs were... really terrible. there was no flavor whatsoever and the seasoning on the lamb meatballs were strange. the meatballs were borderline burnt and the sauce was NOT good. thought the drinks were going to be its saving grace. but woo no. i'm the least pickiest about drinks but sorry, i can't recommend. my friend got the doctor's order and he said it was ok.. the turmeric was very overpowering. i got the salty dog, but it felt watered down and not a ton of flavor. so. yeah. sorry won't be back.","i'm so sorry but i'm literally not a fan of this place. i'm honestly really surprised by all the good reviews. the food is extremely less than mediocre and flavorless. nothing special at all. the vibe of the place is really cute when you walk in but woo, i would not be comfortable spending money here again. i came with a friend and we got fries, liver pate, burrata, butternut squash dumplings, and the lamb meatballs. the best thing were the fries.. which like.. i'm not gonna go to a restaurant to get $7 fries yaknow?

"I came here for brunch after hearing a lot about this place. All of their Covid protocols are on point, and I liked the seating in the back patio compared to the front parklet.

"Great ambiance, pretty good service, hostess a little rude, I was just here yesterday for a Sunday brunch get together. I ordered a Starbelly bacon pizza nothing that amazing didn't even have much flavor surprisingly, and tried the fries with trio of dips, couldn't even tell what the flavors were of the dip? A green one? And a pink colored one? Just tasted like Mayo, bland, and I also ordered a Caesar salad also bland, and there were old pieces of brown lettuce in my salad which made it taste a little bitter and not fresh and that was also bland, and my friend ordered fried chicken dish which was also bland,  and my other friend ordered chilaquiles and she was also disappointed as well, why is the salad taking up the whole dish? Is it a salad dish or a chilaquiles dish? if there's not going to be salt and pepper on the table, season the food please, this was my first time here and I don't think I will ever come back. This is just based on the brunch menu on the weekends. The food looks better than the taste unfortunately.

"Fantastic establishment-- inviting atmosphere, lively clientele and staff, and delicious food and drinks! Def a place with solid Neapolitan pizza.My bf and I came in on a busy Friday night at around 8:40 and had to wait for about 30 minutes. It wasn't too bad and we were able to get a drink at the bar.Margherita pizza (added arugula): very good Neapolitan style pizza! I came here wanting to try one of their pizzas since I looove Neapolitan pizza. Crust is crunchy, yet chewy and the center is so thin. The sauce is on point. (5/5)Mussels with ground chorizo, cilantro, and toasted bread: soooo good! We loved this. So flavorful, and such a generous portion. We didn't expect this ""small plate"" to be that big of a portion. Definitely worth it. (5/5)We also got the burger cooked medium. It was also really good and the fries reminded me of In-n-Out fries! It didn't stand out as much as the other two dishes we ordered though. (4.5/5)I'll definitely be back!

"I think Starbelly is a good option if you are looking for a solid sit-down option in the Castro with plenty of seating. The food ranges from decent to good, but I never find the menu very exciting. After a recent meal there, the best thing I had was the margherita pizza we shared. The veggie burger I had was not great and didn't come with anything else on the side.I usually don't care about service very much, but I can't help but mention that I'm not a fan of dealing with multiple service people. Starbelly is one of the few places where I notice this the most.During my last meal there, one person introduced themselves and took our order. Person #2 brought out our drinks. Person #3 brought out the dishes. Person #1 came back to check on us, but was never around until the check. Then, a 4th person collected our finished plates and glasses. When we needed more napkins and wanted to order another drink, Person #2 & #3 took those orders respectively. I don't know. I just don't get it.Also, when I asked for an entree recommendation, Person #1 suggested the most expensive item on the menu by far. Slightly suss. Even more so when I asked if I could order a cocktail, Person #1 said, ""Of course, we have a full bar."" Right, so then how come I couldn't get a cocktail with soda water in it? I think this review is coming off more harsh than I intended.

"I hate writing a 1 star review when I know restaurants are struggling.  However, a friend asked me where I'd like to go to lunch for my birthday and I said ""Starbelly's"".   I'd eaten there before and knew they had a patio out back which seemed like a perfect choice to eat outside and not freeze. Things started off OK with water being served promptly and our waiter telling us he'd be back to take our order.  We waited, saw two other people be seated next to us and get their order taken before us.  We gave our order to the waiter, two burgers with fries, one well done and the other medium well with cheese.  Our drinks came out and we waited for our meal.  The men next to us received their food before ours which made sense since they got their order in before ours although I did see a pizza delivered, sit there for a couple of minutes, and was taken away like it been misdelivered. Our burgers come out.  Mine is pink and looks good.  My friends is medium rare.  He sends it back.  I start eating so my food won't get cold.  Time passes.  We flag down the waiter who apologizes, but says it takes time to cook the burger to well done.  Yep!  We assumed the cooks knew that too. Waiting a bit longer, my friend cancels his order.  The waiter says we won't be charged, but my friend still declines.  Later the manager comes out and attempts to make amends, saying I won't charge you for the burger and will comp one of the drinks.  I'm thinking, you'll comp the burger that was refused already?  My friend tells me that he arrived about 10 minutes early and the same manager refused to let him 1) have a drink at the bar while he waited for me; 2) then asked him to wait outside even though no one was at the bar.  The manager said he could sit at the bar when I arrived and the party was complete.  Huh?  So, what had been a lunch I was looking forward to celebrate my birthday with a friend ended up leaving a sour taste so to speak.  Now I know, don't go to Starbelly's for special occasions.","i hate writing a 1 star review when i know restaurants are struggling. however, a friend asked me where i'd like to go to lunch for my birthday and i said ""starbelly's"". i'd

"I just wanted to shout out the hostess and servers at Starbelly for making our engagement celebration last night so special and memorable. They brought us both out a glass of bubbly, and when we explained to them that we don't drink, they my fiancee a Mexican coke and myself a BEAUTIFUL prickly pear Shirley Temple (the color of which must be appreciated, see photo). We ordered the chicken pate, cornbread, grilled peaches and the sweet corn pizza and there wasn't a lesser dish out of the bunch.

"Had dinner here last night and wish I could give it a high rating but finding myself not able to. We didn't have reservations and was told it would be about 25 minute wait. A lot of open tables. Noticed people being seated over and over again. About 30 minutes waiting, hostess came over seeming rushed/overwhelmed and was like I can sit you guys here (a table open the entire time). Once seated we waited 15 minutes to be greeted, only after having to ask for service from the hostess. Waiter drops off water crafts, but no glasses. Another 10 minutes and so random person brings over our drinks. The waiter comes over to take our order. We order an appetizer and dinner. About 30 minutes later, our food is delivered. Because we never got the appraiser we tell the food runner that we don't want it anymore, but we would like refills on our drink. Never getting those refills and we are trying to finish our meal, we decide to speak to the manager to see about getting some level of service. The manager comes to the table to speak about what we need, the server starts arguing with us about what he didn't provide. We tell him that we just want simple service like refilling our drinks and delivering the appetizer, which he yells you canceled the appetizer. At this point we are done. Never have I been to a restaurant that a server yells at clients and argues about not doing their job. Food is 5 stars, but the service absolutely sucks. I use to be a restaurant manager and if one of my servers argued in front of me with a customer that server would have been unemployed this morning.","had dinner here last night and wish i could give

"This review is purely for dinner delivery. And, may I say, the food is delicious! Or at least the spaghetti and the warm toffee cake is. The fresh spaghetti with tomato sauce is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes right now. It's simple yet satisfying. And with the Starbelly bacon, it's definitely worth a try. And for dessert, the warm toffee cake hits the spot. Add a dollop of mascarpone and slivered dates and it makes for spoons full of delight. I do hope that one of these days I'll get to enjoy their meals inside Starbelly. But until then, there is so much more to try and get delivered.","this review is purely for dinner delivery. and, may i say, the food is delicious! or at least the spaghetti and the warm toffee cake is. the fresh spaghetti with tomato sauce is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes right now. it's simple yet satisfying. and with the starbelly bacon, it's definitely worth a try. and for dessert, the warm toffee cake hits the spot. add a dollop of mascarpone and slivered dates and it makes for spoons full of delight. i do hope that one of these days i'll get to enjoy their meals inside starbelly. but until then, there is so much more to try and get delivered.",this review is purely for dinner delivery and may i say the food is delicious or at least the spaghetti and the warm toffee cake is the fresh spaghetti with tomato sauce is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes right now its simple yet satisfying and with the starbelly bacon its definitely worth a try and for dessert the warm toffee cake hits the spot add a dollop of mascarpone and slivered dates and it makes for spoons full of delight i do hope that one of these days ill get to enjoy their meals inside starbelly but until then there is so much more to try and get delivered,review purely dinner delivery may say food delicious least spaghetti warm toffee cake fresh spaghetti tomato sauce probably one favorite pasta dishes right simple yet satisfying starbelly bacon definitely worth try dessert warm toffee cake hits spot add dollop mascarpone slivered dates makes spoons full delight hope one days ill get enjoy meals inside starbelly much try get delivered,review purely dinner delivery may say food delicious least spaghetti warm toffee cake fresh spaghetti tomato sauce probably favorite pasta dishes right simple yet satisfying starbelly bacon definitely worth dessert warm toffee cake hits spot add dollop mascarpone slivered dates makes spoons full delight hope days ill enjoy meals inside starbelly much delivered,review purely dinner delivery may say food delicious least spaghetti warm toffee cake fresh spaghetti tomato sauce probably favorite pasta dish right simple yet satisfying starbelly bacon definitely worth dessert warm toffee cake hit spot add dollop mascarpone slivered date make spoon full delight hope day ill enjoy meal inside starbelly much delivered,0.2966666666666667,0.5895238095238095

"Starbelly is always a good bet for brunch or lunch in the Castro. The outdoor patio is great for groups of six and allows you to enjoy a rare nice day in SF.Pizza reigns king in Starbelly but honestly nothing is bad here. Since COVID, they have built out their seating in front of their restaurant even more.Typically end up sharing a pizza, with some arugula on top. The food is nothing to write home about but typically gets it done. I actually really like the cocktails and ambiance (of the back patio) more than anything else.","starbelly is always a good bet for brunch or lunch in the castro. the outdoor patio is great for groups of six and allows you to enjoy a rare nice day in sf.pizza reigns king in starbelly but honestly nothing is bad here. since covid, they have built out their seating in front of their restaurant even more.typically end up sharing a pizza, with some arugula on top. the food is nothing to write home about but typically gets it done. i actually really like the cocktails and ambiance (of the back patio) more than anything else.",starbelly is always a good bet for brunch or lunch in the castro the outdoor patio is great for groups of six and allows you to enjoy a rare nice day in sfpizza reigns king in starbelly but honestly nothing is bad here since covid they have built out their seating in front of their restaurant even moretypically end up sharing a pizza with some arugula on top the food is nothing to write home about but typically gets it done i actually really like the cocktails and ambiance of the back patio more than anything else,starbelly always good bet brunch lunch castro outdoor patio great groups six allows enjoy rare nice day sfpizza reigns king starbelly honestly nothing bad since covid built seating front restaurant even moretypically end sharing pizza arugula top food nothing write home typically gets done actually really like cocktails ambiance back patio anything else,starbelly always good bet brunch lunch castro outdoor patio great groups six allows enjoy rare nice day sfpizza reigns king starbelly honestly nothing bad since covid built seating front restaurant even moretypically end sharing pizza arugula top food nothing write home typically gets done actually really like cocktails ambiance back patio anything else,starbelly always good bet brunch lunch castro outdoor patio great group six allows enjoy rare nice day sfpizza reign king starbelly honestly nothing bad since covid built seating front restaurant even moretypically end sharing pizza arugula top food nothing write home typically get done actually really like cocktail ambiance back patio anything else,0.293939393939394,0.5924242424242425

It's cute, bright, they have covered outdoor seating. hanging lamps, looks pretty typical hipster (they still exist right?) but CUTE and on the fancier side.The music caught our attention though, as it didn't really match the decor, but it kept us laughing the entire time.Starters:Starbelly saladLiver pateEntree:Fried chicken po'boyDessert:Salted Caramel and cornmeal rosemary cookieI didn't get the salad, but my friend said it was good when I asked. It looked very fresh in terms of quality, but the liver pate was the star.It was absolutely fabulous!The baguette was toasted perfectly, with a crunch but not TOO hard where it beats up the roof of your mouth.I'm not a huge fan of mustard, but the pate, marmalade, and mustard was the perfect balance of flavors.I almost forced a piece down my friend's throat it was so good, but I controlled myself to only offered 4 times. (They just aren't a pate person in general.)This definitely set the stage for the po'boy which did not disappoint.They didn't overly season the chicken (though my friend mentioned he could taste the pepper for sure, i didn't get the same).It's got almost a japanese-style breading on it which gives it a different texture than your typical fried chicken but we both enjoyed.they didn't put too much mayo sauce or radicchio, I finished the entire thing after finishing all the pate. The flavors aren't overwhelming and blended well together.It also held together well after cutting it in half which allowed me to devour the entire thing happily.The dessert was the only thing that I won't RAVE about, but it was still good. The creme over the cookie, but the cookie wasn't bad either! It's a thin.... sugar cookie?But it didn't take away from my overall dining experience here.The staff was also amazing. They were prompt at every step, watched when we were ready for the next course, took away our plates in a timely manner.We did have a funny moment when the appetizers were brought over and the waiter/food runner? automatically put the pate in front of my friend (a guy) and the salad in front of me and we had to laugh at the assumption.We left the restaurant BOTH saying that we'd like to return for sure already.Even if it was to have the exact same meal again before restaurant week ends in 5 days.","i don't even know where to begin.i had to write this review as soon as i got to my destination after leaving the starbelly.if the name comes from the idea that you're eating stars here that fill your belly, then take me to heaven!!!i came here with a friend as the first spot for sf restaurant week and i'm sooooo glad i did.it's a cute spot that's great for a date. it's cute, bright, they have covered outdoor seating. hanging lamps, looks pretty typical hipster (they still exist right?) but cute and on the fancier side.the music caught our attention though, as it didn't really match the decor, but it kept us laughing the entire time.starters:starbelly saladliver pateentree:fried chicken po'boydessert:salted caramel and cornmeal rosemary cookiei didn't get the salad, but my friend said it was good when i asked. it looked very fresh in terms of quality, but the liver pate was the star.it was absolutely fabulous!the baguette was toasted perfectly, with a crunch but not too hard where it beats up the roof of your mouth.i'm not a huge fan of mustard, but the pate, marmalade, and mustard was the perfect balance of flavors.i almost forced a piece down my friend's throat it was so good, but i controlled myself to only offered 4 times.

(Summer menu)Booked reservation for 6pm, arrived 10min early and they were accommodating and allowed us to seat early.Servers were on the ball and did a good job of being present without beings overbearing.Our food order was: Squash Dumplings, Fries, Spaghetti (no bacon), Burger, Chicken Sandwich.The squash dumplings were absolutely delicious. 10/10 would get that again.The chicken sandwich was sooooo good as well. I wish i ordered two of those The fries and Spaghetti were good too. Nothing bad to say about that.The failing was the burger. The patty itself tasted on the bland side and an overall let down as i LOVE and am addicted to burgers.  I also asked for a salad for the side but got fries instead. For alcohol my girl got a strawberry vodka something that she adored. I received a white wine sangria, but i felt the ice watered it down, thus taking away from the flavor which was a shame and a let down. They used small ice cubes so it melts faster. I then asked for a beer recommendation to go with my burger and chicken sandwich. My server suggested a Saison which was really good. I was happy with that.Our overall experience at Starbellly was a positive one.It has a lovely date atmosphere and overall good food. Again, while I'm normally a burger man that chicken sandwich was super delicious and next time I'm going to get two of those.","review based on outdoor dining, aug-8, 2020.

"We had a waiter and I don't remember his name but he had a ""Glutes abs muscles"" shirt ( it was 5 words but I don't remember ) ...Anyway he is a real sweetheart and remembered all our orders and I accidentally bumped my head on his butt while laughing at a joke, but he knew it happens all the time with clients, and I felt at home almost instantly because he didn't make me feel embarrassed like I was doing it on purpose and it was like a family reunion on top of my real family reunion. Get 3 of  the margarita verdes and the spaghetti with bacon. I mean, it's like the El Niño in San Francisco with all this rain but starbelly is like a warm island of good vibes and great drinks.

"I had passed by here several times and thought their front setup was nice and safe. I wasn't aware there was a back area when I made reservations. Personally was not a fan of the back area as outdoor dining. Food was good. Had the chicken and waffles and loco moco. Sangria and margarita were ok.  Would probably have been 4 stars if I was seated at the front , which had 2 empty tables when I arrived for reservation. Just my personal preference and feeling of safety.","i had passed by here several times and thought their front setup was nice and safe. i wasn't aware there was a back area when i made reservations. personally was not a fan of the back area as outdoor dining. food was good. had the chicken and waffles and loco moco. sangria and margarita were ok. would probably have been 4 stars if i was seated at the front , which had 2 empty tables when i arrived for reservation. just my personal preference and feeling of safety.",i had passed by here several times and thought their front setup was nice and safe i wasnt aware there was a back area when i made reservations personally was not a fan of the back area as outdoor dining food was good had the chicken and waffles and loco moco sangria and margarita were ok would probably have been 4 stars if i was seated at the front  which had 2 empty tables when i arrived for reservation just my personal preference and feeling of safety,passed several times thought front setup nice safe wasnt aware back area made reservations personally fan back area outdoor dining food good chicken waffles loco moco sangria margarita ok would probably 4 stars seated front 2 empty tables arrived reservation personal preference feeling safety,passed several times thought front setup nice safe wasnt aware back area made reservations personally fan back area outdoor dining food good chicken waffles loco moco sangria margarita ok probably 4 stars seated front 2 empty tables arrived reservation personal preference feeling safety,passed several time thought front setup nice safe wasnt aware back area made reservation personally fan back area outdoor dining food good chicken waffle loco moco sangria margarita ok probably 4 star seated front 2 empty table arrived reservation personal preference feeling safety,0.15416666666666665,0.40833333333333327

"My friend and I came to Starbelly for their SF Restaurant Week special: 3 courses for $15!! That's a steal anywhere in San Francisco. We both picked the same dishes: chicken liver pate, fried chicken poboy, and salted caramel pot de creme. The chicken liver pate was a generous portion size--I didn't even have enough bread to finish it all! I loved the sweet onion marmalade that came with it because it added a sweetness to an otherwise salty spread. The fried chicken poboy came out next. I loved the combo of hot, crunchy chicken, soft bread, and the slaw! I expected it to be spicy because there were so many jalapeños in it, but it wasn't spicy at all. That could be kind of misleading, but luckily I don't eat jalapeños much haha. The salted caramel pot de creme was the perfect ending to our meal. It came with a cornmeal-rosemary cookie. The creme wasn't too sweet and I liked the salt flecks on top. This is probably one of the better and affordable SF Restaurant Week lunch menus--try it if you have the chance!","my friend and i came to starbelly for their sf restaurant week special: 3 courses for $15!! that's a steal anywhere in san francisco. we both picked the same dishes: chicken liver pate, fried chicken poboy, and salted caramel pot de creme. the chicken liver pate was a generous portion size--i didn't even have enough bread to finish it all! i loved the sweet onion marmalade that came with it because it added a sweetness to an otherwise salty spread. the fried chicken poboy came out next. i loved the combo of hot, crunchy chicken, soft bread, and the slaw! i expected it to be spicy because there were so many jalapeños in it, but it wasn't spicy at all. that could be kind of misleading, but luckily i don't eat jalapeños much haha. the salted caramel pot de creme was the perfect ending to our meal. it came with a cornmeal-rosemary cookie. the creme wasn't too sweet and i liked the salt flecks on top. this is probably one of the better and affordable sf restaurant week lunch menus--try it if you have the chance!",my friend and i came to starbelly for their sf restaurant week special 3 courses for 15 thats a steal anywhere in san francisco we both picked the same dishes chicken liver pate fried chicken poboy and salted caramel pot de creme the chicken liver pate was a generous portion sizei didnt even have enough bread to finish it all i loved the sweet onion marmalade that came with it because it added a sweetness to an otherwise salty spread the fried chicken poboy came out next i loved the combo of hot crunchy chicken soft bread and the slaw i expected it to be spicy because there were so many jalapeños in it but it wasnt spicy at all that could be kind of misleading but luckily i dont eat jalapeños much haha the salted caramel pot de creme was the perfect ending to our meal it came with a cornmealrosemary cookie the creme wasnt too sweet and i liked the salt flecks on top this is probably one of the better and affordable sf restaurant week lunch menustry it if you have the chance,friend came starbelly sf restaurant week special 3 courses 15 thats steal anywhere san francisco picked dishes chicken liver pate fried chicken poboy salted caramel pot de creme chicken liver pate generous portion sizei didnt even enough bread finish loved sweet onion marmalade came added sweetness otherwise salty spread fried chicken poboy came next loved combo hot crunchy chicken soft bread slaw expected spicy many jalapeños wasnt spicy could kind misleading luckily dont eat jalapeños much haha salted caramel pot de creme perfect ending meal came cornmealrosemary cookie creme wasnt sweet liked salt flecks top probably one better affordable sf restaurant week lunch menustry chance,friend starbelly sf restaurant week special 3 courses 15 thats steal anywhere san francisco picked dishes chicken liver pate fried chicken poboy salted caramel pot de creme chicken liver pate generous portion sizei didnt even enough bread finish loved sweet onion marmalade added sweetness otherwise salty spread fried chicken poboy next loved combo hot crunchy chicken soft bread slaw expected spicy many jalapeños wasnt spicy could kind misleading luckily dont eat jalapeños much haha salted caramel pot de creme perfect ending meal cornmealrosemary cookie creme wasnt sweet liked salt flecks top probably better affordable sf restaurant week lunch menustry chance,friend starbelly sf restaurant week special 3 course 15 thats steal anywhere san francisco picked dish chicken liver pate fried chicken poboy salted caramel pot de creme chicken liver pate generous portion sizei didnt even enough bread finish loved sweet onion marmalade added sweetness otherwise salty spread fried chicken poboy next loved combo hot crunchy chicken soft bread slaw expected spicy many jalapeños wasnt spicy could kind misleading luckily dont eat jalapeños much haha salted caramel pot de creme perfect ending meal cornmealrosemary cookie creme wasnt sweet liked salt fleck top probably better affordable sf restaurant week lunch menustry chance,0.17132505175983437,0.6806418219461698

"Came here for dinner with a friend before dessert at the newly opened U Dessert Story a block down. We came on a Monday evening around 7:30 and got seated immediately.Neither of us were super hungry, so we decided to split an appetizer and pizza. The calamari escabeche ($11) sounded intriguing, so we started with that and then moved onto their chorizo and egg pizza ($16).I wasn't sure what to expect from the calamari, but I was hoping it'd at least be a hot dish. Unfortunately it wasn't, so it fell flat for me because of that and because it was slightly spicy. I have absolutely zero spice tolerance so it would have been nice to know before ordering. Would probably have ordered something different had I known.I loved the pizza though! It comes with two very runny eggs cooked sunny side up. It was honestly a little hard to grab the slices due to the yolk, but it was worth it as the half cooked egg just melted it my mouth. There was a generous amount of chorizo that paired well with the tomato sauce and the thin crust.Some of their pasta looked really good as well. Going to try that out if I come back!","came here for dinner with a friend before dessert at the newly opened u dessert story a block down. we came on a monday evening around 7:30 and got seated immediately.neither of us were super hungry, so we decided to split an appetizer and pizza. the calamari escabeche ($11) sounded intriguing, so we started with that and then moved onto their chorizo and egg pizza ($16).i wasn't sure what to expect from the calamari, but i was hoping it'd at least be a hot dish. unfortunately it wasn't, so it fell flat for me because of that and because it was slightly spicy. i have absolutely zero spice tolerance so it would have been nice to know before ordering. would probably have ordered something different had i known.i loved the pizza though! it comes with two very runny eggs cooked sunny side up. it was honestly a little hard to grab the slices due to the yolk, but it was worth it as the half cooked egg just melted it my mouth. there was a generous amount of chorizo that paired well with the tomato sauce and the thin crust.some of their pasta looked really good as well. going to try that out if i come back!",came here for dinner with a friend before dessert at the newly opened u dessert story a block down we came on a monday evening around 730 and got seated immediatelyneither of us were super hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and pizza the calamari escabeche 11 sounded intriguing so we started with that and then moved onto their chorizo and egg pizza 16i wasnt sure what to expect from the calamari but i was hoping itd at least be a hot dish unfortunately it wasnt so it fell flat for me because of that and because it was slightly spicy i have absolutely zero spice tolerance so it would have been nice to know before ordering would probably have ordered something different had i knowni loved the pizza though it comes with two very runny eggs cooked sunny side up it was honestly a little hard to grab the slices due to the yolk but it was worth it as the half cooked egg just melted it my mouth there was a generous amount of chorizo that paired well with the tomato sauce and the thin crustsome of their pasta looked really good as well going to try that out if i come back,came dinner friend dessert newly opened u dessert story block came monday evening around 730 got seated immediatelyneither us super hungry decided split appetizer pizza calamari escabeche 11 sounded intriguing started moved onto chorizo egg pizza 16i wasnt sure expect calamari hoping itd least hot dish unfortunately wasnt fell flat slightly spicy absolutely zero spice tolerance would nice know ordering would probably ordered something different knowni loved pizza though comes two runny eggs cooked sunny side honestly little hard grab slices due yolk worth half cooked egg melted mouth generous amount chorizo paired well tomato sauce thin crustsome pasta looked really good well going try come back,dinner friend dessert newly opened u dessert story block monday evening around 730 seated immediatelyneither super hungry decided split appetizer pizza calamari escabeche 11 sounded intriguing started moved onto chorizo egg pizza 16i wasnt sure expect calamari hoping itd least hot dish unfortunately wasnt fell flat slightly spicy absolutely zero spice tolerance nice know ordering probably ordered something different knowni loved pizza though comes two runny eggs cooked sunny side honestly little hard grab slices due yolk worth half cooked egg melted mouth generous amount chorizo paired well tomato sauce thin crustsome pasta looked really good well going come back,dinner friend dessert newly opened u dessert story block monday evening around 730 seated immediatelyneither super hungry decided split appetizer pizza calamari escabeche 11 sounded intriguing started moved onto chorizo egg pizza 16i wasnt sure expect calamari hoping itd least hot dish unfortunately wasnt fell flat slightly spicy absolutely zero spice tolerance nice know ordering probably ordered something different knowni loved pizza though come two runny egg cooked sunny side honestly little hard grab slice due yolk worth half cooked egg melted mouth generous amount chorizo paired well tomato sauce thin crustsome pasta looked really good well going come back,0.08843795093795094,0.542147667147667

"To start, I made a reservation and had to ask the staff inside to see my server after being seated for 20 minutes with only water from the supporting staff. When my not-server approached the table he promptly said the server would be on at a certain time, which is unusual to seat an unopened section at a not busy restaurant. (Our reservation was for 4:30). As my server finally approached, she was distinctly condescending and out right rude at points. She was prompt about not putting food on our table or actually serving us, she never actually introduced herself (the red head on staff I've seen for a while now). Not only did she make a mistake on our order, as she placed the check she was gruff toward check splitting or multiple cards. I have been to starbelly several times and NEVER had service as unprofessional as tonight. The serving staff was absolutely absurd in their action and I hope to not encounter anything like this again. As always the food was yummy.","to start, i made a reservation and had to ask the staff inside to see my server after being seated for 20 minutes with only water from the supporting staff. when my not-server approached the table he promptly said the server would be on at a certain time, which is unusual to seat an unopened section at a not busy restaurant.

"This place is fun with a group of friends.  Came here on Saturday night and ordered way too much food.  We (four of us) shared the white purée with flatbread (4/5), cheese plate (3/5), beet salad (5/5), chicken liver patee (4/5), goat cheese dumpling (4/5) and bacon pizza (5/5).  I got the grilled bavette steak with parsnip purée (4/5) and ate some of the fries that my friends couldn't finish (5/5).  Food wise, it's a solid 4 and I highly recommend that bacon pizza. The ambiance is nice but it gets very loud and very busy here. The food came out really fast but the service got a little spotty when it got busy.  Our one main complaint was that the seats were really uncomfortable. It's a good value though - the above meal plus some wine is around $70 per person, including tax and tip.  I would definitely eat here again.","this place is fun with a group of friends. came here on saturday night and ordered way too much food. we (four of us) shared the white purée with flatbread (4/5), cheese plate (3/5), beet salad (5/5), chicken liver patee (4/5), goat cheese dumpling (4/5) and bacon pizza (5/5). i got the grilled bavette steak with parsnip purée (4/5) and ate some of the fries that my friends couldn't finish (5/5). food wise, it's a solid 4 and i highly recommend that bacon pizza. the ambiance is nice but it gets very loud and very busy here. the food came out really fast but the service got a little spotty when it got busy. our one main complaint was that the seats were really uncomfortable. it's a good value though - the above meal plus some wine is around $70 per person, including tax and tip. i would definitely eat here again.",this place is fun with a group of friends came here on saturday night and ordered way too much food we four of us shared the white purée with flatbread 45 cheese plate 35 beet salad 55 chicken liver patee 45 goat cheese dumpling 45 and bacon pizza 55 i got the grilled bavette steak with parsnip purée 45 and ate some of the fries that my friends couldnt finish 55 food wise its a solid 4 and i highly recommend that bacon pizza the ambiance is nice but it gets very loud and very busy here the food came out really fast but the service got a little spotty when it got busy our one main complaint was that the seats were really uncomfortable its a good value though  the above meal plus some wine is around 70 per person including tax and tip i would definitely eat here again,place fun group friends came saturday night ordered way much food four us shared white purée flatbread 45 cheese plate 35 beet salad 55 chicken liver patee 45 goat cheese dumpling 45 bacon pizza 55 got grilled bavette steak parsnip purée 45 ate fries friends couldnt finish 55 food wise solid 4 highly recommend bacon pizza ambiance nice gets loud busy food came really fast service got little spotty got busy one main complaint seats really uncomfortable good value though meal plus wine around 70 per person including tax tip would definitely eat,place fun group friends saturday night ordered way much food four shared white purée flatbread 45 cheese plate 35 beet salad 55 chicken liver patee 45 goat cheese dumpling 45 bacon pizza 55 grilled bavette steak parsnip purée 45 ate fries friends couldnt finish 55 food wise solid 4 highly recommend bacon pizza ambiance nice gets loud busy food really fast service little spotty busy main complaint seats really uncomfortable good value though meal plus wine around 70 per person including tax tip definitely eat,place fun group friend saturday night ordered way much food four shared white purée flatbread 45 cheese plate 35 beet salad 55 chicken liver patee 45 goat cheese dumpling 45 bacon pizza 55 grilled bavette steak parsnip purée 45 ate fry friend couldnt finish 55 food wise solid 4 highly recommend bacon pizza ambiance nice get loud busy food really fast service little spotty busy main complaint seat really uncomfortable good value though meal plus wine around 70 per person including tax tip definitely eat,0.09662037037037037,0.5012962962962964

"I'm so sad! My fiancé and I came with reservation to try out dishes. We had sent an inquiry for our after wedding brunch and planned to have a small gathering here with friends.

"Star belly was very cognizant of mask wearing for all its staff and patrons. We felt very comfortable the entire time we were there. Our waitress was not the most friendly and attentive but overall a good experience. In regards to the food, the brussels sprouts were very good. Also loved their lemonade. The mussels left a little to be desired, but the chorizo was a good add. I wish they had some gluten free option for their pizzas or just generally for many items on their menu. I felt limited as a gluten free diner and our waitress did little to point out options for me but maybe one day they will add. I would go back but wouldn't be my first choice.","star belly was very cognizant of mask wearing for all its staff and patrons. we felt very comfortable the entire time we were there. our waitress was not the most friendly and attentive but overall a good experience. in regards to the food, the brussels sprouts were very good. also loved their lemonade. the mussels left a little to be desired, but the chorizo was a good add. i wish they had some gluten free option for their pizzas or just generally for many items on their menu. i felt limited as a gluten free diner and our waitress did little to point out options for me but maybe one day they will add. i would go back but wouldn't be my first choice.",star belly was very cognizant of mask wearing for all its staff and patrons we felt very comfortable the entire time we were there our waitress was not the most friendly and attentive but overall a good experience in regards to the food the brussels sprouts were very good also loved their lemonade the mussels left a little to be desired but the chorizo was a good add i wish they had some gluten free option for their pizzas or just generally for many items on their menu i felt limited as a gluten free diner and our waitress did little to point out options for me but maybe one day they will add i would go back but wouldnt be my first choice,star belly cognizant mask wearing staff patrons felt comfortable entire time waitress friendly attentive overall good experience regards food brussels sprouts good also loved lemonade mussels left little desired chorizo good add wish gluten free option pizzas generally many items menu felt limited gluten free diner waitress little point options maybe one day add would go back wouldnt first choice,star belly cognizant mask wearing staff patrons felt comfortable entire time waitress friendly attentive overall good experience regards food brussels sprouts good also loved lemonade mussels left little desired chorizo good add wish gluten free option pizzas generally many items menu felt limited gluten free diner waitress little point options maybe day add back wouldnt first choice,star belly cognizant mask wearing staff patron felt comfortable entire time waitress friendly attentive overall good experience regard food brussels sprout good also loved lemonade mussel left little desired chorizo good add wish gluten free option pizza generally many item menu felt limited gluten free diner waitress little point option maybe day add back wouldnt first choice,0.28214285714285725,0.5000661375661377

"I came here today for a late Saturday brunch around 2pm and didn't have to wait at all to get a table for 5. If you come during peak brunch hours, I can easily see the wait being upwards of an hour. I ordered the fried chicken po-boy ($10) along with a michelada ($6) for my meal. The fried chicken po-boy was very well constructed. I often order fried chicken sandwiches when I visit restaurants and one issue I frequently encounter is the sandwich is too dry. The fried chicken itself can be juicy, but without enough slaw and dressing, the sandwich can be pretty tough to eat. The po-boy at Starbelly doesn't have this issue at all. I liked that the sandwich had generous amounts of sliced jalapeño inside, but I wish they would've left more of the seeds in so the sandwich would have more of a kick.Overall, pretty good brunch experience. Food was a little on the slow side coming out of the kitchen, so be sure to order a drink to kill time while you wait.","i came here today for a late saturday brunch around 2pm and didn't have to wait at all to get a table for 5. if you come during peak brunch hours, i can easily see the wait being upwards of an hour. i ordered the fried chicken po-boy ($10) along with a michelada ($6) for my meal. the fried chicken po-boy was very well constructed. i often order fried chicken sandwiches when i visit restaurants and one issue i frequently encounter is the sandwich is too dry. the fried chicken itself can be juicy, but without enough slaw and dressing, the sandwich can be pretty tough to eat. the po-boy at starbelly doesn't have this issue at all. i liked that the sandwich had generous amounts of sliced jalapeño inside, but i wish they would've left more of the seeds in so the sandwich would have more of a kick.overall, pretty good brunch experience. food was a little on the slow side coming out of the kitchen, so be sure to order a drink to kill time while you wait.",i came here today for a late saturday brunch around 2pm and didnt have to wait at all to get a table for 5 if you come during peak brunch hours i can easily see the wait being upwards of an hour i ordered the fried chicken poboy 10 along with a michelada 6 for my meal the fried chicken poboy was very well constructed i often order fried chicken sandwiches when i visit restaurants and one issue i frequently encounter is the sandwich is too dry the fried chicken itself can be juicy but without enough slaw and dressing the sandwich can be pretty tough to eat the poboy at starbelly doesnt have this issue at all i liked that the sandwich had generous amounts of sliced jalapeño inside but i wish they wouldve left more of the seeds in so the sandwich would have more of a kickoverall pretty good brunch experience food was a little on the slow side coming out of the kitchen so be sure to order a drink to kill time while you wait,came today late saturday brunch around 2pm didnt wait get table 5 come peak brunch hours easily see wait upwards hour ordered fried chicken poboy 10 along michelada 6 meal fried chicken poboy well constructed often order fried chicken sandwiches visit restaurants one issue frequently encounter sandwich dry fried chicken juicy without enough slaw dressing sandwich pretty tough eat poboy starbelly doesnt issue liked sandwich generous amounts sliced jalapeño inside wish wouldve left seeds sandwich would kickoverall pretty good brunch experience food little slow side coming kitchen sure order drink kill time wait,today late saturday brunch around 2pm didnt wait table 5 come peak brunch hours easily see wait upwards hour ordered fried chicken poboy 10 along michelada 6 meal fried chicken poboy well constructed often order fried chicken sandwiches visit restaurants issue frequently encounter sandwich dry fried chicken juicy without enough slaw dressing sandwich pretty tough eat poboy starbelly doesnt issue liked sandwich generous amounts sliced jalapeño inside wish wouldve left seeds sandwich kickoverall pretty good brunch experience food little slow side coming kitchen sure order drink kill time wait,today late saturday brunch around 2pm didnt wait table 5 come peak brunch hour easily see wait upwards hour ordered fried chicken poboy 10 along michelada 6 meal fried chicken poboy well constructed often order fried chicken sandwich visit restaurant issue frequently encounter sandwich dry fried chicken juicy without enough slaw dressing sandwich pretty tough eat poboy starbelly doesnt issue liked sandwich generous amount sliced jalapeño inside wish wouldve left seed sandwich kickoverall pretty good brunch experience food little slow side coming kitchen sure order drink kill time wait,-0.04498456790123454,0.7030864197530865
"I've been dining at Starbelly for over 5 years and every time I go to SF. it's always consistent and good. The menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other San Francisco restaurants. With that said, I suggest ordering the Loco Moco. It's a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy, yet comfortable. The pizzas at Starbelly are fantastic as well. If you are going for brunch, I suggest the Chorizo and sunny egg. It makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch. Their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced. Nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food!","i've been dining at starbelly for over 5 years and every time i go to sf. it's always consistent and good. the menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other san francisco restaurants. with that said, i suggest ordering the loco moco. it's a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy, yet comfortable. the pizzas at starbelly are fantastic as well. if you are going for brunch, i suggest the chorizo and sunny egg. it makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch. their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced. nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food!",ive been dining at starbelly for over 5 years and every time i go to sf its always consistent and good the menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other san francisco restaurants with that said i suggest ordering the loco moco its a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy yet comfortable the pizzas at starbelly are fantastic as well if you are going for brunch i suggest the chorizo and sunny egg it makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food,ive dining starbelly 5 years every time go sf always consistent good menu unique eclectic scratching head wondering ordered unlike many san francisco restaurants said suggest ordering loco moco perfect entrée looking something hardy yet comfortable pizzas starbelly fantastic well going brunch suggest chorizo sunny egg makes unique take pizza taste like breakfast brunch drink list also delightful reasonably priced nothing beats fun sparkling rosé tasty cocktail fantastic food,ive dining starbelly 5 years every time sf always consistent good menu unique eclectic scratching head wondering ordered unlike many san francisco restaurants said suggest ordering loco moco perfect entrée looking something hardy yet comfortable pizzas starbelly fantastic well going brunch suggest chorizo sunny egg makes unique take pizza taste like breakfast brunch drink list also delightful reasonably priced nothing beats fun sparkling rosé tasty cocktail fantastic food,ive dining starbelly 5 year every time sf always consistent good menu unique eclectic scratching head wondering ordered unlike many san francisco restaurant said suggest ordering loco moco perfect entrée looking something hardy yet comfortable pizza starbelly fantastic well going brunch suggest chorizo sunny egg make unique take pizza taste like breakfast brunch drink list also delightful reasonably priced nothing beat fun sparkling rosé tasty cocktail fantastic food,0.4916666666666667,0.7291666666666666
"Located on 16the and Noe which is a difficult area to find parking in general. Only street parking available. Luckily there wasn't a long wait. Brunch was disappointing so maybe I have to come back to taste their dinner menu. The best thing we ate out of everything we ordered was the Starbelly pizza. The batter used on the fish for their fish tacos was dense almost like a hard biscuit. The chilaquiles was mediocre given that it was the traditional dish. One of the chicken po' boys seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way through. The fries was decent and the salad was a good alternative side. Their michelada was orange which was different. Their shandy (beer and lemonade) was refreshing. The sangira was overly sweet, tasted like fruit juice. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch; however, I've heard their dinner menu is better.

"Starbelly is an excellent option for date night! My husband had just flew back in from NYC; so we decided to meet here for dinner.I arrived at the restaurant first where I was greeted by the host who was very friendly! She immediately sat me at our table and let me know someone would be with me shortly.I was soon greeted by the server who poured me some water in my glass and asked if I would like to order a beverage. I decided on the Pimm's Cup which was really great and refreshing.I ordered two appetizers the French fries and the margarita pizza with two eggs. Both appetizers arrived just as my husband was sitting down. We both loved the two options; they were full of flavor and delicious! The waitress then came over and ask to take our main course order. I had the veggie burger and my husband had the butternut squash dumplings, and the starbelly salad... we were both raving about how amazing the food was.Starbelly is an excellent option for anyone who is vegetarian and I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in SF!

"Huge s/o to my friends Vanessa & Rey for taking me here for dinner last night. This place is a 5-star in all it's forms. Their menu has excellent selections with creative items but not doing too much; everything is straight to the point with awesome ingredients. We shared everything like family style. We started off with house cut fries & three dips and house-made chicken liver pâté with buttered toast. It also came with sweet onion marmalade and grainy mustard which provided a nice kick. For our main course, we shared two pizzas and a pasta. The pizzas are on point! They're cooked by brick-oven style with a nice flat crust. We had a pizza topped with Starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula,and special green dressing which was out of this world. This pizza was fresh and full of flavors. The bacon was cooked to perfection and provided a nice salty bite to it. Our second pizza was topped with house-made chorizo, sunny eggs and cilantro. The egg yolk provided some texture while the chorizo was flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness. Their pizzas here are very creative and a must-get! Our service was great! The food is cooked form scratch but is delivered to your table on time! The ambiance is great too with dim lighting and an outside seating area for a more lively vibe. Their cocktails are of course unique with different mixes. My favorite was their Starbelly 75 which had Dolin Dry, Lillet Blanc, ginger, cava, and lemon. My cocktail was a bit carbonated which was nice! It wasn't heavy nor was it dull. It had the taste of punch soda but had that cocktail form and taste! It was simply amazing.If you're in SF and looking for a spot to eat for dinner, you should include this onto your list. You can't go wrong here.","huge s/o to my friends vanessa & rey for taking me here for dinner last night. this place is a 5-star in all it's forms. their menu has excellent selections with creative items but not doing too much; everything is straight to the point with awesome ingredients. we shared everything like family style. we started off with house cut fries & three dips and house-made chicken liver pâté with buttered toast. it also came with sweet onion marmalade and grainy mustard which provided a nice kick. for our main course, we shared two pizzas and a pasta. the pizzas are on point! they're cooked by brick-oven style with a nice flat crust. we had a pizza topped with starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula,and special green dressing which was out of this world. this pizza was fresh and full of flavors. the bacon was cooked to perfection and provided a nice salty bite to it. our second pizza was topped with house-made chorizo, sunny eggs and cilantro. the egg yolk provided some texture while the chorizo was flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness. their pizzas here are very creative and a must-get! our service was great! the food is cooked form scratch but is

"Post-Barry's BrunchWhat a better way to spend a Saturday than workout and brunch? I went to Barry's Castro with a friend, and we rewarded ourselves with Starbelly. The service was great! We had the perfect amount of time to catch up and look at the menu before ordering our food. They were super accommodating and let us order the chicken liver pâté, which was not on the weekend brunch menu. It was perfectly toasted bread drizzled with olive oil. The pâté was accompanied with delicious mustard and marmalade, too.I had the fish tacos and a mimosa, which were really good. Ate it all! My friend had a fried chicken sandwich, which she also enjoyed. She also wanted an Irish coffee, which wasn't on the menu, but they offered her a latte with a whiskey shot. Love the ingenuity!","post-barry's brunchwhat a better way to spend a saturday than workout and brunch? i went to barry's castro with a friend, and we rewarded ourselves with starbelly. the service was great! we had the perfect amount of time to catch up and look at the menu before ordering our food. they were super accommodating and let us order the chicken liver pâté, which was not on the weekend brunch menu. it was perfectly toasted bread drizzled with olive oil. the pâté was accompanied with delicious mustard and marmalade, too.i had the fish tacos and a mimosa, which were really good. ate it all! my friend had a fried chicken sandwich, which she also enjoyed. she also wanted an irish coffee, which wasn't on the menu, but they offered her a latte with a whiskey shot. love the ingenuity!",postbarrys brunchwhat a better way to spend a saturday than workout and brunch i went to barrys castro with a friend and we rewarded ourselves with starbelly the service was great we had the perfect amount of time to catch up and look at the menu before ordering our food they were super accommodating and let us order the chicken liver pâté which was not on the weekend brunch menu it was perfectly toasted bread drizzled with olive oil the pâté was accompanied with delicious mustard and marmalade tooi had the fish tacos and a mimosa which were really good ate it all my friend had a fried chicken sandwich which she also enjoyed she also wanted an irish coffee which wasnt on the menu but they offered her a latte with a whiskey shot love the ingenuity,postbarrys brunchwhat better way spend saturday workout brunch went barrys castro friend rewarded starbelly service great perfect amount time catch look menu ordering food super accommodating let us order chicken liver pâté weekend brunch menu perfectly toasted bread drizzled olive oil pâté accompanied delicious mustard marmalade tooi fish tacos mimosa really good ate friend fried chicken sandwich also enjoyed also wanted irish coffee wasnt menu offered latte whiskey shot love ingenuity,postbarrys brunchwhat better way spend saturday workout brunch went barrys castro friend rewarded starbelly service great perfect amount time catch look menu ordering food super accommodating let order chicken liver pâté weekend brunch menu perfectly toasted bread drizzled olive oil pâté accompanied delicious mustard marmalade tooi fish tacos mimosa really good ate friend fried chicken sandwich also enjoyed also wanted irish coffee wasnt menu offered latte whiskey shot love ingenuity,postbarrys brunchwhat better way spend saturday workout brunch went barrys castro friend rewarded starbelly service great perfect amount time catch look menu ordering food super accommodating let order chicken liver pâté weekend brunch menu perfectly toasted bread drizzled olive oil pâté accompanied delicious mustard marmalade tooi fish taco mimosa really good ate friend fried chicken sandwich also enjoyed also wanted irish coffee wasnt menu offered latte whiskey shot love ingenuity,0.4277777777777778,0.7263888888888889
"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT. Starbelly used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but after this experience it is now my LEAST favorite. Made a reservation for three people a few days prior and when we showed up, we were made to wait ten minutes only to be seated at a table where we couldn't get anyone's attention. It was clearly the shitty table - the one with the cold metal furniture tucked inside this makeshift outdoor dining tent. Once seated, we waited another 15 minutes just to get some water and ONE menu. I stood up to find the host, and he must have seen me coming because only then did he come with water and the menu. IMMEDIATELY after handing it to us, the host asked us for our order. We obviously didn't get the chance to read it yet, so he said that he would be back later. Never came back, so we tried to flag down two servers. They both either did not see us or flat out ignored us, waiting on other tables that had already been served food. We sat there for ANOTHER 20 minutes without anyone coming to check on us. At this point, we were extremely thirsty and desperately trying to get someone to pay attention. I ended up joining a waitlist for another restaurant. Guess what? We actually had fast and friendly service there even though both restaurants were equally busy! Walking away from Starbelly, we noticed that our table was immediately filled with a new party. That tells me that they had been watching our table and just chose not to help us. I understand being busy and maintaining a new set of rules due to the pandemic, but you should prioritize guests who have been waiting for so long. No apologies for the delay were ever exchanged. Before anyone thinks that it was at all my party's fault for the terrible service, know that we were patient with them the entire time and gave them the correct information for the reservation. They simply chose to ignore us, stealing an hour of our time. Don't eat here. Don't entertain this place at all. This may be a popular and busy restaurant, but they should never forget why - the business of the guests. Put them first.","worst service i have ever had at a restaurant. starbelly used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but after this experience it is now my least favorite. made a

"My friend and I came here to celebrate my birthday on a Sunday night and MAN the place was poppin'. It felt more like a Friday night pre-game than a Sunday night weekend winddown. Thankfully, we had reservations so we were able to get seated almost immediately. They have a great selection of cocktails for all different tastes (fruity, less fruity, etc.). I went with Strawberry Alarm Clock, which was exactly what I   was craving. Fruity, light, and bubbly..but adult. For our dinner, we ordered the mussels for our starter and the starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula & green goddess dressing pizza. Both were excellent! The broth that came with the mussels was super flavorful and the waitress was nice enough to bring us extra pieces of bread so we could soak up the leftover broth. The pizza has a super thin crispy crust, but was topped with a generous amount of toppings. I thought the combination of flavors from the bacon, jalapeno, veggies, and the creamy dressing was great as well! Just FYI, portions are on the smaller side, so I would err on the side of ordering a bit more, especially if you are coming with a hungry group.","my friend and i came here to celebrate my birthday on a sunday night and man the place was poppin'. it felt more like a friday night pre-game than a sunday night weekend winddown. thankfully, we had reservations so we were able to get seated almost immediately. they have a great selection of cocktails for all different tastes (fruity, less fruity, etc.). i went with strawberry alarm clock, which was exactly what i was craving. fruity, light, and bubbly..but adult. for our dinner, we ordered the mussels for our starter and the starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula & green goddess dressing pizza. both were excellent! the broth that came with the mussels was super flavorful and the waitress was nice enough to bring us extra pieces of bread so we could soak up the leftover broth. the pizza has a super thin crispy crust, but was topped with a generous amount of toppings. i thought the combination of flavors from the bacon, jalapeno, veggies, and the creamy dressing was great as well! just fyi, portions are on the smaller side, so i would err on the side of ordering a bit more, especially if you are coming with a hungry group.",my friend and i came here to celebrate my birthday on a sunday night and man the place was poppin it felt more like a friday night pregame than a sunday night weekend winddown thankfully we had reservations so we were able to get seated almost immediately they have a great selection of cocktails for all different tastes fruity less fruity etc i went with strawberry alarm clock which was exactly what i was craving fruity light and bubblybut adult for our dinner we ordered the mussels for our starter and the starbelly bacon jalapeño arugula  green goddess dressing pizza both were excellent the broth that came with the mussels was super flavorful and the waitress was nice enough to bring us extra pieces of bread so we could soak up the leftover broth the pizza has a super thin crispy crust but was topped with a generous amount of toppings i thought the combination of flavors from the bacon jalapeno veggies and the creamy dressing was great as well just fyi portions are on the smaller side so i would err on the side of ordering a bit more especially if you are coming with a hungry group,friend came celebrate birthday sunday night man place poppin felt like friday night pregame sunday night weekend winddown thankfully reservations able get seated almost immediately great selection cocktails different tastes fruity less fruity etc went strawberry alarm clock exactly craving fruity light bubblybut adult dinner ordered mussels starter starbelly bacon jalapeño arugula green goddess dressing pizza excellent broth came mussels super flavorful waitress nice enough bring us extra pieces bread could soak leftover broth pizza super thin crispy crust topped generous amount toppings thought combination flavors bacon jalapeno veggies creamy dressing great well fyi portions smaller side would err side ordering bit especially coming hungry group,friend celebrate birthday sunday night man place poppin felt like friday night pregame sunday night weekend winddown thankfully reservations able seated almost immediately great selection cocktails different tastes fruity less fruity etc went strawberry alarm clock exactly craving fruity light bubblybut adult dinner ordered mussels starter starbelly bacon jalapeño arugula green goddess dressing pizza excellent broth mussels super flavorful waitress nice enough bring extra pieces bread could soak leftover broth pizza super thin crispy crust topped generous amount toppings thought combination flavors bacon jalapeno veggies creamy dressing great well fyi portions smaller side err side ordering bit especially coming hungry group,friend celebrate birthday sunday night man place poppin felt like friday night pregame sunday night weekend winddown thankfully reservation able seated almost immediately great selection cocktail different taste fruity le fruity etc went strawberry alarm clock exactly craving fruity light bubblybut adult dinner ordered mussel starter starbelly bacon jalapeño arugula green goddess dressing pizza excellent broth mussel super flavorful waitress nice enough bring extra piece bread could soak leftover broth pizza super thin crispy crust topped generous amount topping thought combination flavor bacon jalapeno veggie creamy dressing great well fyi portion smaller side err side ordering bit especially coming hungry group,0.265686274509804,0.621078431372549
"This was our first time dining at Starbelly in the Castro. It was fantastic! The food was really, really great. We ordered the vegan veggie burger (dried pea and quinoa patty, cucumbers and white been puree). It was outstanding actually, one of the best veggie burgers we've ever had, anywhere, ever. It was perfectly grilled and flavored. Amazing. Their house cut fries go perfectly with this burger (ordered separately), were also super tasty. Comfort food on steroids. We really loved this experience last night (1/14/18). The service was good, not exceptional but completely acceptable. The only bummer was that 3 of the wines by the glass we selected were out of stock. Despite that, our server guided us toward some decent Argentina wines that were quite good.This place was great and the fact they can accommodate a vegan diet without any issues was extra special. It's got a great ascetic interior design, nice tables and overall great vibe. I would definitely suggest making a restoration like we did otherwise you're going to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table on a busy night. We'll be back for sure.","this was our first time dining at starbelly in the castro. it was fantastic! the food was really, really great. we ordered the vegan veggie burger (dried pea and quinoa patty, cucumbers and white been puree). it was outstanding actually, one of the best veggie burgers we've ever had, anywhere, ever. it was perfectly grilled and flavored. amazing. their house cut fries go perfectly with this burger (ordered separately), were also super tasty. comfort food on steroids. we really loved this experience last night (1/14/18). the service was good, not exceptional but completely acceptable. the only bummer was that 3 of the wines by the glass we selected were out of stock. despite that, our server guided us toward some decent argentina wines that were quite good.this place was great and the fact they can accommodate a vegan diet without any issues was extra special. it's got a great ascetic interior design, nice tables and overall great vibe. i would definitely suggest making a restoration like we did otherwise you're going to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table on a busy night. we'll be back for sure.",this was our first time dining at starbelly in the castro it was fantastic the food was really really great we ordered the vegan veggie burger dried pea and quinoa patty cucumbers and white been puree it was outstanding actually one of the best veggie burgers weve ever had anywhere ever it was perfectly grilled and flavored amazing their house cut fries go perfectly with this burger ordered separately were also super tasty comfort food on steroids we really loved this experience last night 11418 the service was good not exceptional but completely acceptable the only bummer was that 3 of the wines by the glass we selected were out of stock despite that our server guided us toward some decent argentina wines that were quite goodthis place was great and the fact they can accommodate a vegan diet without any issues was extra special its got a great ascetic interior design nice tables and overall great vibe i would definitely suggest making a restoration like we did otherwise youre going to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table on a busy night well be back for sure,first time dining starbelly castro fantastic food really really great ordered vegan veggie burger dried pea quinoa patty cucumbers white puree outstanding actually one best veggie burgers weve ever anywhere ever perfectly grilled flavored amazing house cut fries go perfectly burger ordered separately also super tasty comfort food steroids really loved experience last night 11418 service good exceptional completely acceptable bummer 3 wines glass selected stock despite server guided us toward decent argentina wines quite goodthis place great fact accommodate vegan diet without issues extra special got great ascetic interior design nice tables overall great vibe would definitely suggest making restoration like otherwise youre going wait 30 minutes hour table busy night well back sure,first time dining starbelly castro fantastic food really really great ordered vegan veggie burger dried pea quinoa patty cucumbers white puree outstanding actually best veggie burgers weve ever anywhere ever perfectly grilled flavored amazing house cut fries perfectly burger ordered separately also super tasty comfort food steroids really loved experience last night 11418 service good exceptional completely acceptable bummer 3 wines glass selected stock despite server guided toward decent argentina wines quite goodthis place great fact accommodate vegan diet without issues extra special great ascetic interior design nice tables overall great vibe definitely suggest making restoration like otherwise youre going wait 30 minutes hour table busy night well back sure,first time dining starbelly castro fantastic food really really great ordered vegan veggie burger dried pea quinoa patty cucumber white puree outstanding actually best veggie burger weve ever anywhere ever perfectly grilled flavored amazing house cut fry perfectly burger ordered separately also super tasty comfort food steroid really loved experience last night 11418 service good exceptional completely acceptable bummer 3 wine glass selected stock despite server guided toward decent argentina wine quite goodthis place great fact accommodate vegan diet without issue extra special great ascetic interior design nice table overall great vibe definitely suggest making restoration like otherwise youre going wait 30 minute hour table busy night well back sure,0.39564860426929394,0.5989189928845101
"Pros:* Ambiance of the place is great. I came during a warm weather though. So it wasn't cold, windows were open. Lights were dim, a bit romantic as well.* Margherita pizza was great. We got the cheese add-on for an extra $4 or $5, it's so creamy. Though you'd probably be fine without getting it. I personally wouldn't get it again, I'd rather use the extra money for getting another appetizer.* The brussel sprout was phenomenal. You definitely need to try it.Cons:* None that I could think of. At least my experience there was enjoyable, nothing to complain. It was a quick in and out.Conclusion:Will probably come back again to try their brunch. Dinner, will probably not, unless I'm really craving their food type. I personally like Asian food more, so I'm definitely biased here.","pros:* ambiance of the place is great. i came during a warm weather though. so it wasn't cold, windows were open. lights were dim, a bit romantic as well.* margherita pizza was great. we got the cheese add-on for an extra $4 or $5, it's so creamy. though you'd probably be fine without getting it. i personally wouldn't get it again, i'd rather use the extra money for getting another appetizer.* the brussel sprout was phenomenal. you definitely need to try it.cons:* none that i could think of. at least my experience there was enjoyable, nothing to complain. it was a quick in and out.conclusion:will probably come back again to try their brunch. dinner, will probably not, unless i'm really craving their food type. i personally like asian food more, so i'm definitely biased here.",pros ambiance of the place is great i came during a warm weather though so it wasnt cold windows were open lights were dim a bit romantic as well margherita pizza was great we got the cheese addon for an extra 4 or 5 its so creamy though youd probably be fine without getting it i personally wouldnt get it again id rather use the extra money for getting another appetizer the brussel sprout was phenomenal you definitely need to try itcons none that i could think of at least my experience there was enjoyable nothing to complain it was a quick in and outconclusionwill probably come back again to try their brunch dinner will probably not unless im really craving their food type i personally like asian food more so im definitely biased here,pros ambiance place great came warm weather though wasnt cold windows open lights dim bit romantic well margherita pizza great got cheese addon extra 4 5 creamy though youd probably fine without getting personally wouldnt get id rather use extra money getting another appetizer brussel sprout phenomenal definitely need try itcons none could think least experience enjoyable nothing complain quick outconclusionwill probably come back try brunch dinner probably unless im really craving food type personally like asian food im definitely biased,pros ambiance place great warm weather though wasnt cold windows open lights dim bit romantic well margherita pizza great cheese addon extra 4 5 creamy though youd probably fine without getting personally wouldnt id rather use extra money getting another appetizer brussel sprout phenomenal definitely need itcons none could think least experience enjoyable nothing complain quick outconclusionwill probably come back brunch dinner probably unless really craving food type personally like asian food definitely biased,pro ambiance place great warm weather though wasnt cold window open light dim bit romantic well margherita pizza great cheese addon extra 4 5 creamy though youd probably fine without getting personally wouldnt id rather use extra money getting another appetizer brussel sprout phenomenal definitely need itcons none could think least experience enjoyable nothing complain quick outconclusionwill probably come back brunch dinner probably unless really craving food type personally like asian food definitely biased,0.17045454545454547,0.4454545454545454
"Came here for restaurant week and had a 3 course lunch for $15! Ordered the pate, chicken poboy, and pot de creme for dessert. Chicken liver pate: 5/5! So delicious and they gave a generous portion. Served with two pieces of bread, marmalade and mustard. I personally was putting both the marmalade and mustard on the bread, topped with the pate. All three blended together well and balanced each other out. Chicken poboy: 3.5/5. Poboy was a decent size, definitely enough to fill you up, but not be overly full.

"Nice ambiance. Sat at the back enclosed area, which is nice that it's enclosed. Ordered Dr's Order drink, which was okay. Flavor wasn't very strong. Ordered pate, which is my favorite. It comes with bread, sweet onion marmalade and grain mustard. The sweet onion marmalade is very good with the pate!  Got the cheddar cheese grit sticks. It comes in 3, which is a tad pricey, but the dill aioli was good with it. Also ordered the mushroom onion pizza.

"After a boozy noon at the Lucky 13, my buddies and I struck out get something to eat.  One of them suggested Starbelly saying that it was his regular late afternoon lunch spot.  I didn't argue and we meandered to restaurant.  My concern was that it would be packed and we'd have a long wait.  Fortunately, it wasn't and we were sat immediately.  After a quick review of the menu I asked what type of cuisine it was, and buddy said new American.  I don't get out much as I used to but I had not heard of that.  It was good though.I ordered the fried chicken Po Boy sandwich with french fries.  Basically, it's a fried chicken breast with a jalapeno & radicchio slaw.  Man, it was good.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The addition of jalapenos was a surprise, but brilliant with the slaw.  Wow, really awesome.  The shoestring fries were delicious and plentiful.  Sometimes restaurants drop the ball on the fries, but Starbelly scores.  For me, thick-cut fries would not have paired well with the Po Boy.  This was a place I would not have chosen, and thankfully my buddy made the call.  I'd be happy to go back anytime, and will.","after a boozy noon at the

"Stopped here last Thursday with a group of friends for one of our birthdays. It was pretty good. The service was so so and the food was also just so so, but overall a good experience. We ordered a slew of appetizers - the potato sticks, calamari, and some others. Nothing stood out as great to me. We then ordered a burger and the mushroom pizza and split it. The pizza was just okay, nothing special, but the burger was solid! Cooked perfectly and had everything we wanted. Fries good too. I think the best part was the drinks. I ordered a mescal cocktail and got it extra spicy - yummy! Very good and refreshing and spicy just like I like it. Service was pretty good, ambiance was even better. Probably wouldn't come back except to try the brunch cus the fried chicken and waffles looks good!","stopped here last thursday with a group of friends for one of our birthdays. it was pretty good. the service was so so and the food was also just so so, but overall a good experience. we ordered a slew of appetizers - the potato sticks, calamari, and some others. nothing stood out as great to me. we then ordered a burger and the mushroom pizza and split it. the pizza was just okay, nothing special, but the burger was solid! cooked perfectly and had everything we wanted. fries good too. i think the best part was the drinks. i ordered a mescal cocktail and got it extra spicy - yummy! very good and refreshing and spicy just like i like it. service was pretty good, ambiance was even better. probably wouldn't come back except to try the brunch cus the fried chicken and waffles looks good!",stopped here last thursday with a group of friends for one of our birthdays it was pretty good the service was so so and the food was also just so so but overall a good experience we ordered a slew of appetizers  the potato sticks calamari and some others nothing stood out as great to me we then ordered a burger and the mushroom pizza and split it the pizza was just okay nothing special but the burger was solid cooked perfectly and had everything we wanted fries good too i think the best part was the drinks i ordered a mescal cocktail and got it extra spicy  yummy very good and refreshing and spicy just like i like it service was pretty good ambiance was even better probably wouldnt come back except to try the brunch cus the fried chicken and waffles looks good,stopped last thursday group friends one birthdays pretty good service food also overall good experience ordered slew appetizers potato sticks calamari others nothing stood great ordered burger mushroom pizza split pizza okay nothing special burger solid cooked perfectly everything wanted fries good think best part drinks ordered mescal cocktail got extra spicy yummy good refreshing spicy like like service pretty good ambiance even better probably wouldnt come back except try brunch cus fried chicken waffles looks good,stopped last thursday group friends birthdays pretty good service food also overall good experience ordered slew appetizers potato sticks calamari others nothing stood great ordered burger mushroom pizza split pizza okay nothing special burger solid cooked perfectly everything wanted fries good think best part drinks ordered mescal cocktail extra spicy yummy good refreshing spicy like like service pretty good ambiance even better probably wouldnt come back except brunch cus fried chicken waffles looks good,stopped last thursday group friend birthday pretty good service food also overall good experience ordered slew appetizer potato stick calamari others nothing stood great ordered burger mushroom pizza split pizza okay nothing special burger solid cooked perfectly everything wanted fry good think best part drink ordered mescal cocktail extra spicy yummy good refreshing spicy like like service pretty good ambiance even better probably wouldnt come back except brunch cu fried chicken waffle look good,0.41700680272108837,0.5446712018140589

"I liked the food and ambiance here. It's got a modern look with sidewalk booths, inside seating, and a back patio area. They took reservations. I ordered the Cobb salad which came with chicken, bacon, and green goddess dressing. The dressing did not have a strong or remarkable taste but the salad was good overall. The pate was very delicious. I was glad to try since I've never had pate before. My only negative was that the server was slow: it took a while to give our order, and I had to ask him two times for the same request.

"Dined in recently for a birthday party.  I was late, but made it in time for a few of their starters. The ground chorizo and peppers were plentiful in the roasted Black Mussels dish, and the sauce went very well with toast.  I also had the pleasure in tasting their house made chicken pate.  Light and flavorful, this pate lived up to it's reputation!  We also shared some pizzas. Their Margherita with fresh mozzarella was pretty average, in a good way!  The Market Mushroom with Gruyere tasted fantastic.  It was filled with mushrooms, and unfortunately was way on the soggy side.  But their house made chorizo with cilantro pizza was superb!  The star of my belly that night was the burger.  But not any ordinary burger.  I had it Doc's way...which is not on the menu.  The fact that they even have a secret menu gives me more excitement to dine here.  But it's all about their chicken liver pate. Their burger Doc's Way is the Prather ranch patty with the addition of a humongous slice of pate.  The abundance of pickles and onions weren't needed much as the onion marmalade and chicken liver pate had an overwhelming presence.  Although the burger was a bit overcooked to my liking, the fat layer of pate made up for it.  I'll request a medium rare on my next visit.  Yes, there will be a next time!  And with flawless service, how can I resist?","dined in recently for a birthday party. i was late, but made it in time for a few of their starters. the ground chorizo and peppers were plentiful in the roasted black mussels dish, and the sauce went very well with toast. i also had the pleasure in tasting their house made chicken pate. light and flavorful, this pate lived up to it's reputation!

"Cute, hip restaurant in Castro! Honestly, this general area is so much fun. Lots of bars. Lots of life - so definitely come here for dinner and continue partying elsewhere in the district! Vegetarian friendly - but not vegan friendly - so if you're a strict vegan, your money would be put to better use at a different restaurant. I ordered the spaghetti dish which is topped with starbelly bacon, jalapeno, basil, and shaved grana. Super yummy, 5/5 for flavor + value. Their cocktails are on point.

"I wanted to love Starbelly so badly on a wonderful recommendation from my friend but I would have to say my food experience here was mediocre. The cheddar cheese grit sticks were an interesting spin on polenta I suppose - gooey and soft on the inside and fried to a crisp on the outside. These were an interesting item on the menu.My friend swore by the pate, which was pretty good but nothing to drive home about. The bread was thick and crusty with a standard chicken liver spread that is quite classy for a date night. The pizzas here are pretty unique and deliciously crafted. As someone spoiled by NYC pizza, I would give the Starbelly pizza around a 3.75 out of 5, which is pretty good. We got the unique roasted corn, white cheddar, Aleppo chile, cilantro & lime aioli one. It has a cool Mexican spin with the sweet corn mixed in the cheese. I got a prickly pear cocktail, which was a pretty good as well. Overall, I would say Starbelly has decent new American fare, with a west coast Hispanic influence.","i wanted to love starbelly so badly on a wonderful recommendation from my friend but i would have to say my food experience here was mediocre. the cheddar cheese grit sticks were an interesting spin on polenta i suppose - gooey and soft on the inside and fried to a crisp on the outside. these were an interesting item on the menu.my friend swore by the pate, which was pretty good but nothing to drive home about. the bread was thick and crusty with a standard chicken liver spread that is quite classy for a date night. the pizzas here are pretty unique and deliciously crafted. as someone spoiled by nyc pizza, i would give the starbelly pizza around a 3.75 out of 5, which is pretty good. we got the unique roasted corn, white cheddar, aleppo chile, cilantro & lime aioli one. it has a cool mexican spin with the sweet corn mixed in the cheese. i got a prickly pear cocktail, which was a pretty good as well. overall, i would say starbelly has decent new american fare, with a west coast hispanic influence.",i wanted to love starbelly so badly on a wonderful recommendation from my friend but i would have to say my food experience here was mediocre the cheddar cheese grit sticks were an interesting spin on polenta i suppose  gooey and soft on the inside and fried to a crisp on the outside these were an interesting item on the menumy friend swore by the pate which was pretty good but nothing to drive home about the bread was thick and crusty with a standard chicken liver spread that is quite classy for a date night the pizzas here are pretty unique and deliciously crafted as someone spoiled by nyc pizza i would give the starbelly pizza around a 375 out of 5 which is pretty good we got the unique roasted corn white cheddar aleppo chile cilantro  lime aioli one it has a cool mexican spin with the sweet corn mixed in the cheese i got a prickly pear cocktail which was a pretty good as well overall i would say starbelly has decent new american fare with a west coast hispanic influence,wanted love starbelly badly wonderful recommendation friend would say food experience mediocre cheddar cheese grit sticks interesting spin polenta suppose gooey soft inside fried crisp outside interesting item menumy friend swore pate pretty good nothing drive home bread thick crusty standard chicken liver spread quite classy date night pizzas pretty unique deliciously crafted someone spoiled nyc pizza would give starbelly pizza around 375 5 pretty good got unique roasted corn white cheddar aleppo chile cilantro lime aioli one cool mexican spin sweet corn mixed cheese got prickly pear cocktail pretty good well overall would say starbelly decent new american fare west coast hispanic influence,wanted love starbelly badly wonderful recommendation friend say food experience mediocre cheddar cheese grit sticks interesting spin polenta suppose gooey soft inside fried crisp outside interesting item menumy friend swore pate pretty good nothing drive home bread thick crusty standard chicken liver spread quite classy date night pizzas pretty unique deliciously crafted someone spoiled nyc pizza give starbelly pizza around 375 5 pretty good unique roasted corn white cheddar aleppo chile cilantro lime aioli cool mexican spin sweet corn mixed cheese prickly pear cocktail pretty good well overall say starbelly decent new american fare west coast hispanic influence,wanted love starbelly badly wonderful recommendation friend say food experience mediocre cheddar cheese grit stick interesting spin polenta suppose gooey soft inside fried crisp outside interesting item menumy friend swore pate pretty good nothing drive home bread thick crusty standard chicken liver spread quite classy date night pizza pretty unique deliciously crafted someone spoiled nyc pizza give starbelly pizza around 375 5 pretty good unique roasted corn white cheddar aleppo chile cilantro lime aioli cool mexican spin sweet corn mixed cheese prickly pear cocktail pretty good well overall say starbelly decent new american fare west coast hispanic influence,0.2388074291300098,0.5875122189638319
"Loved it! Came here with 4 people on Sunday evening and the vibe was amazing, we sat on the patio and really enjoyed it. We got the flatbread and white beans for an appetizer and it was super creamy and a nice way to start off the meal. Non-alcoholic drinks were also on point and fair-priced too. We also got Margherita Pizza, the burger, and spaghetti - all of which we enjoyed a lot. It was a great time! I want to try brunch here.","loved it! came here with 4 people on sunday evening and the vibe was amazing, we sat on the patio and really enjoyed it. we got the flatbread and white beans for an appetizer and it was super creamy and a nice way to start off the meal. non-alcoholic drinks were also on point and fair-priced too. we also got margherita pizza, the burger, and spaghetti - all of which we enjoyed a lot. it was a great time! i want to try brunch here.",loved it came here with 4 people on sunday evening and the vibe was amazing we sat on the patio and really enjoyed it we got the flatbread and white beans for an appetizer and it was super creamy and a nice way to start off the meal nonalcoholic drinks were also on point and fairpriced too we also got margherita pizza the burger and spaghetti  all of which we enjoyed a lot it was a great time i want to try brunch here,loved came 4 people sunday evening vibe amazing sat patio really enjoyed got flatbread white beans appetizer super creamy nice way start meal nonalcoholic drinks also point fairpriced also got margherita pizza burger spaghetti enjoyed lot great time want try brunch,loved 4 people sunday evening vibe amazing sat patio really enjoyed flatbread white beans appetizer super creamy nice way start meal nonalcoholic drinks also point fairpriced also margherita pizza burger spaghetti enjoyed lot great time want brunch,loved 4 people sunday evening vibe amazing sat patio really enjoyed flatbread white bean appetizer super creamy nice way start meal nonalcoholic drink also point fairpriced also margherita pizza burger spaghetti enjoyed lot great time want brunch,0.5041666666666667,0.6895833333333333

"A great place for brunch with a group! Came here with a group of 6, definitely recommend making a reservation in advance if possible. We were seated right when we got there, and I requested to be seated on the patio which we did get! The patio is great--it's covered everywhere but natural light does come in. It's a good size and perfect for brunch.Service was good! The only slight downfall was that one of the dishes came out much sooner than the others, which can be hard when waiting for a group.  Food was great though, I ended up splitting the chilaquiles and roasted corn pizza--the corn pizza was something that was brought back to the menu and it was delicious! Chilaquiles were good too, and came with a side salad with goat cheese.They do not have bottomless mimosas but they do have a menu of other drinks including mimosas.

"Went here with a friend while visiting San Fran and was disappointed by the food.Service was good and it was very packed, so seems like they get good business. I appreciate that the menu is seasonal, which means that there are fresh and new options every few months. However, the fish that I ordered tasted so...fishy.

We just expected something better given the good reviews and upscale quality of the restaurant. The pate was good though - just be sure to ask for extra bread!We also sat beneath a bookshelf at the back of the restaurant that seemed a little precarious.

"One of the few brunch places where you can make a reservation so you don't get trapped in a line with no end (Kitchen Story, Brenda's, etc). It was full of people at 1pm, and we ended up in a corner behind the bar, but still got good service and attention. I ordered the Sunnyside Joe's, and the waiter nicely let me replace the potatoes with a side salad. My friend had the Loco Moco. The first thing I noticed when my dish came was that the eggs were unevenly cooked. One of them was super watery and gooey, while the other's yolk was fully cooked. The ground beef wasn't well-seasoned and didn't contribute much to the dish besides taking up space. My friend's Loco Moco was a little less disappointing; the sauce was apparently good, especially having soaked into the rice. But the problem with this place is that the portions are SO SMALL. It's not right to pay ~$15 for a plate of eggs and meat that won't fill you up. Make plans for dessert afterwards or order a French Toast to share. Otherwise, you'll leave unsatisfied.","one of the few brunch places where you can make a reservation so you don't get trapped in a line with no end (kitchen story, brenda's, etc). it was full of people at 1pm, and we ended up in a corner behind the bar, but still got good service and attention. i ordered the sunnyside joe's, and the waiter nicely let me replace the potatoes with a side salad. my friend had the loco moco. the first thing i noticed when my dish came was that the eggs were unevenly cooked. one of them was super watery and gooey, while the other's yolk was fully cooked. the ground beef wasn't well-seasoned and didn't contribute much to the dish besides taking up space. my friend's loco moco was a little less disappointing; the sauce was apparently good, especially having soaked into the rice. but the problem with this place is that the portions are so small. it's not right to pay ~$15 for a plate of eggs and meat that won't fill you up. make plans for dessert afterwards or order a french toast to share. otherwise, you'll leave unsatisfied.",one of the few brunch places where you can make a reservation so you dont get trapped in a line with no end kitchen story brendas etc it was full of people at 1pm and we ended up in a corner behind the bar but still got good service and attention i ordered the sunnyside joes and the waiter nicely let me replace the potatoes with a side salad my friend had the loco moco the first thing i noticed when my dish came was that the eggs were unevenly cooked one of them was super watery and gooey while the others yolk was fully cooked the ground beef wasnt wellseasoned and didnt contribute much to the dish besides taking up space my friends loco moco was a little less disappointing the sauce was apparently good especially having soaked into the rice but the problem with this place is that the portions are so small its not right to pay 15 for a plate of eggs and meat that wont fill you up make plans for dessert afterwards or order a french toast to share otherwise youll leave unsatisfied,one brunch places make reservation dont get trapped line end kitchen story brendas etc full people 1pm ended corner behind bar still got good service attention ordered sunnyside joes waiter nicely let replace potatoes side salad friend loco moco first thing noticed dish came eggs unevenly cooked one super watery gooey others yolk fully cooked ground beef wasnt wellseasoned didnt contribute much dish besides taking space friends loco moco little less disappointing sauce apparently good especially soaked rice problem place portions small right pay 15 plate eggs meat wont fill make plans dessert afterwards order french toast share otherwise youll leave unsatisfied,brunch places make reservation dont trapped line end kitchen story brendas etc full people 1pm ended corner behind bar still good service attention ordered sunnyside joes waiter nicely let replace potatoes side salad friend loco moco first thing noticed dish eggs unevenly cooked super watery gooey others yolk fully cooked ground beef wasnt wellseasoned didnt contribute much dish besides taking space friends loco moco little less disappointing sauce apparently good especially soaked rice problem place portions small right pay 15 plate eggs meat wont fill make plans dessert afterwards order french toast share otherwise youll leave unsatisfied,brunch place make reservation dont trapped line end kitchen story brendas etc full people 1pm ended corner behind bar still good service attention ordered sunnyside joes waiter nicely let replace potato side salad friend loco moco first thing noticed dish egg unevenly cooked super watery gooey others yolk fully cooked ground beef wasnt wellseasoned didnt contribute much dish besides taking space friend loco moco little le disappointing sauce apparently good especially soaked rice problem place portion small right pay 15 plate egg meat wont fill make plan dessert afterwards order french toast share otherwise youll leave unsatisfied,0.09884672619047616,0.4991071428571429

My fiancé ordered the fried chicken with French toast and an IPA and I ordered the least coast burger again, but this time I added cooked onions and blue cheese. I ordered my burger lettuce wrapped because I am gluten intolerant. Our waiter took our order without writing anything down.  I was disappointed to see my burger came out with a bun, but the server said he would get it fixed. I wish he had asked if I wanted them to make another or if it was ok for him to just lay it over lettuce. I would have preferred another, but they just lettuce wrapped the first one. When I got my plate back, my fries were cold. Still tasty, but not fresh tasting. It was just disappointing after my first visit here. My fiancé really loved his French toast and chicken- he said even though it was fried chicken, it didn't feel heavy and that the French toast was cooked perfectly. I still love the lavender lemonade! Side note: the bathroom needs more lighting. It's like walking into a haunted house- it is so dark! Overall, I am a bit disappointed with this visit. My food was nowhere near the quality that it was when I went the first time. I will likely come back, but I will be hesitant.","i came back here today since i was in the area and enjoyed it so much last time. we were quickly seated by the bartender out to the beautiful patio in the back. we were greeted by our server and left to look over our menus. my fiancé ordered the fried chicken with french toast and an ipa and i ordered the least coast burger again, but this time i added cooked onions and blue cheese. i ordered my burger lettuce wrapped because i am gluten intolerant. our waiter took our order without writing anything down. i was disappointed to see my burger came out with a bun, but the server said he would get it fixed. i wish he had asked if i wanted them to make another or if it was ok for him to just lay it over lettuce. i would have preferred another, but they just lettuce wrapped the first one. when i got my plate back, my fries were cold. still tasty, but not fresh tasting. it was just disappointing after my first visit here. my fiancé really loved his french toast and chicken- he said even though it was fried chicken, it didn't feel heavy and that the french toast was cooked perfectly. i still love the lavender lemonade!

"Holy. Moley. This place was AH-MAZING!  Cute little gastropub in San Francisco. We came in right at opening on a Wednesday for brunch/lunch. The menu is extensive and gluten Free friendly. The servers were knowledgeable about what can be prepared gluten free and what couldn't be. There was plenty of seating available, and they have this beautiful patio in the back of the restaurant and which is a great place to sit for some fresh air and to unwind. Our server was super friendly and was on top of everything we needed. Food wise, this was one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. I ordered their burger and had it lettuce wrapped, and added white cheddar and avocado. It was SO good and you can really taste how fresh it is. It doesn't taste frozen at all. They serve this with a heaping portion of fries and offer green goddess dressing upon request for dipping. My dad ordered the chiliquiles and he was in HEAVEN! They looked amazing, and smelled so good. He said the amount of flavor was unlike any others he had had before. I also got a lavender lemonade with my meal which wasn't overly sweet- it was just right with a perfect twist of lavender. Overall, I will for sure be back here and recommend to all my friends!","holy. moley. this place was ah-mazing! cute little gastropub in san francisco. we came in right at opening on a wednesday for brunch/lunch. the menu is extensive and gluten free friendly. the servers were knowledgeable about what can be prepared gluten free and what couldn't be. there was plenty of seating available, and they have this beautiful patio in the back of the restaurant and which is a great place to sit for some fresh air and to unwind. our server was super friendly and was on top of everything we needed. food wise, this was one of the best restaurants i've ever eaten at. i ordered their burger and had it lettuce wrapped, and added white cheddar and avocado. it was so good and you can really taste how fresh it is. it doesn't taste frozen at all. they serve this with a heaping portion of fries and offer green goddess dressing upon request for dipping. my dad ordered the chiliquiles and he was in heaven! they looked amazing, and smelled so good. he said the amount of flavor was unlike any others he had had before. i also got a lavender lemonade with my meal which wasn't overly sweet- it was just right with a perfect twist of lavender. overall, i will for sure be back here and recommend to all my friends!",holy moley this place was ahmazing cute little gastropub in san francisco we came in right at opening on a wednesday for brunchlunch the menu is extensive and gluten free friendly the servers were knowledgeable about what can be prepared gluten free and what couldnt be there was plenty of seating available and they have this beautiful patio in the back of the restaurant and which is a great place to sit for some fresh air and to unwind our server was super friendly and was on top of everything we needed food wise this was one of the best restaurants ive ever eaten at i ordered their burger and had it lettuce wrapped and added white cheddar and avocado it was so good and you can really taste how fresh it is it doesnt taste frozen at all they serve this with a heaping portion of fries and offer green goddess dressing upon request for dipping my dad ordered the chiliquiles and he was in heaven they looked amazing and smelled so good he said the amount of flavor was unlike any others he had had before i also got a lavender lemonade with my meal which wasnt overly sweet it was just right with a perfect twist of lavender overall i will for sure be back here and recommend to all my friends,holy moley place ahmazing cute little gastropub san francisco came right opening wednesday brunchlunch menu extensive gluten free friendly servers knowledgeable prepared gluten free couldnt plenty seating available beautiful patio back restaurant great place sit fresh air unwind server super friendly top everything needed food wise one best restaurants ive ever eaten ordered burger lettuce wrapped added white cheddar avocado good really taste fresh doesnt taste frozen serve heaping portion fries offer green goddess dressing upon request dipping dad ordered chiliquiles heaven looked amazing smelled good said amount flavor unlike others also got lavender lemonade meal wasnt overly sweet right perfect twist lavender overall sure back recommend friends,holy moley place ahmazing cute little gastropub san francisco right opening wednesday brunchlunch menu extensive gluten free friendly servers knowledgeable prepared gluten free couldnt plenty seating available beautiful patio back restaurant great place sit fresh air unwind server super friendly top everything needed food wise best restaurants ive ever eaten ordered burger lettuce wrapped added white cheddar avocado good really taste fresh doesnt taste frozen serve heaping portion fries offer green goddess dressing upon request dipping dad ordered chiliquiles heaven looked amazing smelled good said amount flavor unlike others also lavender lemonade meal wasnt overly sweet right perfect twist lavender overall sure back recommend friends,holy moley place ahmazing cute little gastropub san francisco right opening wednesday brunchlunch menu extensive gluten free friendly server knowledgeable prepared gluten free couldnt plenty seating available beautiful patio back restaurant great place sit fresh air unwind server super friendly top everything needed food wise best restaurant ive ever eaten ordered burger lettuce wrapped added white cheddar avocado good really taste fresh doesnt taste frozen serve heaping portion fry offer green goddess dressing upon request dipping dad ordered chiliquiles heaven looked amazing smelled good said amount flavor unlike others also lavender lemonade meal wasnt overly sweet right perfect twist lavender overall sure back recommend friend,0.3822420634920635,0.5386772486772488

"Eh. I mean this place does have a nice selection of food but I would stick to what's popular and skip the experimental items. We ordered the fig salad- it was good but we could have skipped this one. Fried Grits- the dipping sauce was excellent but the grits itself needed more salt or at least some sea salt on the outside of the sticks. We asked for recommendations and they had a seasonal pizza which I thought was sad...It was the corn pizza that was bland. One thing...Don't go to star belly for their pizzas..

Love the onion marmalade and the mustard was on point. The mussels were impeccable! And I'm not a great seafood fan so props on making a fabulous dish. The mushroom pizza was very rich so expect a punch of a flavor. But that was already too much for me so we had to box it home. Overall, loved it.

"Good for drinks. Another classic over-crowded ""alright"" brunch place. First, their service has been quite rude the past two times I've been there. I don't blame the staff, but the management seems to do shady things like - having their lunch menu on SF restaurant week, but not offering it on the weekends and not noting that anywhere on the menu.I've been here twice - once for drinks, and once for brunch. Would recommend as a cute drink place, but not going to be a go-to for food for me.For brunch, I got the sunny side joe's, which was bland and eggs were way over cooked. We also got charged for all small changes (sub arugula for cilantro on a pizza and charged $2 without telling us).","good for drinks. another classic over-crowded ""alright"" brunch place. first, their service has been quite rude the past two times i've been there. i don't blame the staff, but the management seems to do shady things like - having their lunch menu on sf restaurant week, but not offering it on the weekends and not noting that anywhere on the menu.i've been here twice - once for drinks, and once for brunch. would recommend as a cute drink place, but not going to be a go-to for food for me.for brunch, i got the sunny side joe's, which was bland and eggs were way over cooked. we also got charged for all small changes (sub arugula for cilantro on a pizza and charged $2 without telling us).",good for drinks another classic overcrowded alright brunch place first their service has been quite rude the past two times ive been there i dont blame the staff but the management seems to do shady things like  having their lunch menu on sf restaurant week but not offering it on the weekends and not noting that anywhere on the menuive been here twice  once for drinks and once for brunch would recommend as a cute drink place but not going to be a goto for food for mefor brunch i got the sunny side joes which was bland and eggs were way over cooked we also got charged for all small changes sub arugula for cilantro on a pizza and charged 2 without telling us,good drinks another classic overcrowded alright brunch place first service quite rude past two times ive dont blame staff management seems shady things like lunch menu sf restaurant week offering weekends noting anywhere menuive twice drinks brunch would recommend cute drink place going goto food mefor brunch got sunny side joes bland eggs way cooked also got charged small changes sub arugula cilantro pizza charged 2 without telling us,good drinks another classic overcrowded alright brunch place first service quite rude past two times ive dont blame staff management seems shady things like lunch menu sf restaurant week offering weekends noting anywhere menuive twice drinks brunch recommend cute drink place going goto food mefor brunch sunny side joes bland eggs way cooked also charged small changes sub arugula cilantro pizza charged 2 without telling,good drink another classic overcrowded alright brunch place first service quite rude past two time ive dont blame staff management seems shady thing like lunch menu sf restaurant week offering weekend noting anywhere menuive twice drink brunch recommend cute drink place going goto food mefor brunch sunny side joes bland egg way cooked also charged small change sub arugula cilantro pizza charged 2 without telling,0.044444444444444446,0.5342592592592593
"The fava bean dumplings were *chef's kiss* the perfect savory bite. It was creamy, savory, and a little tangy. I loved how it was such a unique item and executed so well. The price point for the dish was a little steep at $2.5 per dumpling. The veggie burger was huge and came with a small mountain of fries. There was no indication of fries coming with the burger and maybe I should have asked, so I also ordered the fries with 3 dips. The fries were just as fries should be in taste and texture, but a lot of the pieces were quite short. The veggie patty exterior was crunchy and the bun was soft and fluffy. Maybe it's just my personal preference, but I wanted a saucier burger with a sharper flavor. The service was good.","the fava bean dumplings were *chef's kiss* the perfect savory bite. it was creamy, savory, and a little tangy. i loved how it was such a unique item and executed so well. the price point for the dish was a little steep at $2.5 per dumpling. the veggie burger was huge and came with a small mountain of fries. there was no indication of fries coming with the burger and maybe i should have asked, so i also ordered the fries with 3 dips. the fries were just as fries should be in taste and texture, but a lot of the pieces were quite short. the veggie patty exterior was crunchy and the bun was soft and fluffy. maybe it's just my personal preference, but i wanted a saucier burger with a sharper flavor. the service was good.",the fava bean dumplings were chefs kiss the perfect savory bite it was creamy savory and a little tangy i loved how it was such a unique item and executed so well the price point for the dish was a little steep at 25 per dumpling the veggie burger was huge and came with a small mountain of fries there was no indication of fries coming with the burger and maybe i should have asked so i also ordered the fries with 3 dips the fries were just as fries should be in taste and texture but a lot of the pieces were quite short the veggie patty exterior was crunchy and the bun was soft and fluffy maybe its just my personal preference but i wanted a saucier burger with a sharper flavor the service was good,fava bean dumplings chefs kiss perfect savory bite creamy savory little tangy loved unique item executed well price point dish little steep 25 per dumpling veggie burger huge came small mountain fries indication fries coming burger maybe asked also ordered fries 3 dips fries fries taste texture lot pieces quite short veggie patty exterior crunchy bun soft fluffy maybe personal preference wanted saucier burger sharper flavor service good,fava bean dumplings chefs kiss perfect savory bite creamy savory little tangy loved unique item executed well price point dish little steep 25 per dumpling veggie burger huge small mountain fries indication fries coming burger maybe asked also ordered fries 3 dips fries fries taste texture lot pieces quite short veggie patty exterior crunchy bun soft fluffy maybe personal preference wanted saucier burger sharper flavor service good,fava bean dumpling chef kiss perfect savory bite creamy savory little tangy loved unique item executed well price point dish little steep 25 per dumpling veggie burger huge small mountain fry indication fry coming burger maybe asked also ordered fry 3 dip fry fry taste texture lot piece quite short veggie patty exterior crunchy bun soft fluffy maybe personal preference wanted saucier burger sharper flavor service good,0.2041666666666667,0.5875
"We were in SF for a friend's birthday and she selected this place for brunch. The atmosphere is nice and the patio seating looked cool. The place was very packed on a Saturday morning I wouldn't expect any less. The service was pretty quick for our party of 11. The drinks were all pretty good I loved mine which had gin and elderberry, but I can't remember the name of it. I ordered the French toast but wasn't a fan of the fruit jam or whatever it was that was spread onto it. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles which I tried and liked. The chicken was moist and the waffles were great.","we were in sf for a friend's birthday and she selected this place for brunch. the atmosphere is nice and the patio seating looked cool. the place was very packed on a saturday morning i wouldn't expect any less. the service was pretty quick for our party of 11. the drinks were all pretty good i loved mine which had gin and elderberry, but i can't remember the name of it. i ordered the french toast but wasn't a fan of the fruit jam or whatever it was that was spread onto it. my husband ordered the chicken and waffles which i tried and liked. the chicken was moist and the waffles were great.",we were in sf for a friends birthday and she selected this place for brunch the atmosphere is nice and the patio seating looked cool the place was very packed on a saturday morning i wouldnt expect any less the service was pretty quick for our party of 11 the drinks were all pretty good i loved mine which had gin and elderberry but i cant remember the name of it i ordered the french toast but wasnt a fan of the fruit jam or whatever it was that was spread onto it my husband ordered the chicken and waffles which i tried and liked the chicken was moist and the waffles were great,sf friends birthday selected place brunch atmosphere nice patio seating looked cool place packed saturday morning wouldnt expect less service pretty quick party 11 drinks pretty good loved mine gin elderberry cant remember name ordered french toast wasnt fan fruit jam whatever spread onto husband ordered chicken waffles tried liked chicken moist waffles great,sf friends birthday selected place brunch atmosphere nice patio seating looked cool place packed saturday morning wouldnt expect less service pretty quick party 11 drinks pretty good loved mine gin elderberry cant remember name ordered french toast wasnt fan fruit jam whatever spread onto husband ordered chicken waffles tried liked chicken moist waffles great,sf friend birthday selected place brunch atmosphere nice patio seating looked cool place packed saturday morning wouldnt expect le service pretty quick party 11 drink pretty good loved mine gin elderberry cant remember name ordered french toast wasnt fan fruit jam whatever spread onto husband ordered chicken waffle tried liked chicken moist waffle great,0.2819444444444445,0.75

"Cute spot, came here on a Wednesday night to catch up with some friends. There's a lot of street metered parking but the no left turns are a pain.  The food was pretty good!Appetizer: Their house made mushroom dumplings were to die for! Honestly I've had my fair share of dumplings and I wasn't expecting too much, the wrap was so amazing, it melted in my mouth. There were different layers of wraps and delicious cheese as well. It was pretty pricey though, around $11 for 3 dumplings, lol. We also had the chicken patte which was also very delicious. I enjoyed the sweet raspberry (?) sauce that it came with! Very delicious and worth trying. Main dishes: I had their spaghetti which the waitress recommended as a good start when trying out this spot, it had bacon pieces in it with thick noodles (almost like thick chow mein noodles). The sauce was a little spicy and the bacon was a good touch! The house made bangers & mash was soo good as well! It came with delicious meat with mash potatoes, sausages and apples! I loved it lol. I wasn't expecting the apples to be so delicious in the dish!Overall this spot had really interesting dishes. The waitress also told us sometimes the dishes switch around , but I enjoyed pretty much everything! Im definitely down to try different dishes here the next time I come!","cute spot, came here on a wednesday night to catch up with some friends. there's a lot of street metered parking but the no left turns are a pain. the food was pretty good!appetizer: their house made mushroom dumplings were to die for!

"Looking for a brunch spot where the price and service are up to par? In SF? With a full bar? Great menu selection? And very hipster? Try out Starbelly.  You wont regret it.  The hostess and our server were super nice.  Service was fast. And the price was just right for the plate you get.I recommend you try their ""house made chicken liver pãté with buttered bread, grain mustard and sweet onion marmalade"" (so good!)  Very light and satisfying plate and did I mention really good?!  You get a balance of sweet and salty & moist and savory.  I really liked it.  Their house cut fries with three dipping sauce was also bomb.  Great way to start  our brunch.  We also ordered their spaghetti with bacon, jalapeño, and basil. Yummy!   And one can never go wrong with their pizza margherita with fresh mozzarella and basil just because we didn't order enough carbs today. Hahaha!  There is an indoor and outdoor eating area.  The outdoor is fully tented which is aesthetically pleasing because you get the outdoor experience without having your hair blowing in your face and no flies fighting to taste your food selection!   The howling wind was nice to hear beat against the fully covered tent.  Succulents mounted on the walls were relaxing.  Nice touch.Did I mention they are furry friendly too?

"Yum this place has great food and great service! They have a cute outdoor seating area in the back of the restaurant and it's slightly covered, which is great because you get the sunniness of being outdoors without overheating...I came on labor day weekend, and since my sister was visiting, we had a large party. The server was really accommodating and even split the bill for us as we requested! I tried the loco moco (plus avocado), chicken and waffles, and the burger. The chicken and waffles was good - I've had better ones elsewhere, but starbelly's was pretty decent. Everything we ate was pretty good, not amazing but definitely satisfying.We also tried their caramel pot de creme, which was delicious! It's a tiny pot of caramel pudding like stuff with some shortbread cookies on the side. Perfect for dessert!","yum this place has great food and great service! they have a cute outdoor seating area in the back of the restaurant and it's slightly covered, which is great because you get the sunniness of being outdoors without overheating...i came on labor day weekend, and since my sister was visiting, we had a large party. the server was really accommodating and even split the bill for us as we requested! i tried the loco moco (plus avocado), chicken and waffles, and the burger. the chicken and waffles was good - i've had better ones elsewhere, but starbelly's was pretty decent. everything we ate was pretty good, not amazing but definitely satisfying.we also tried their caramel pot de creme, which was delicious! it's a tiny pot of caramel pudding like stuff with some shortbread cookies on the side. perfect for dessert!",yum this place has great food and great service they have a cute outdoor seating area in the back of the restaurant and its slightly covered which is great because you get the sunniness of being outdoors without overheatingi came on labor day weekend and since my sister was visiting we had a large party the server was really accommodating and even split the bill for us as we requested i tried the loco moco plus avocado chicken and waffles and the burger the chicken and waffles was good  ive had better ones elsewhere but starbellys was pretty decent everything we ate was pretty good not amazing but definitely satisfyingwe also tried their caramel pot de creme which was delicious its a tiny pot of caramel pudding like stuff with some shortbread cookies on the side perfect for dessert,yum place great food great service cute outdoor seating area back restaurant slightly covered great get sunniness outdoors without overheatingi came labor day weekend since sister visiting large party server really accommodating even split bill us requested tried loco moco plus avocado chicken waffles burger chicken waffles good ive better ones elsewhere starbellys pretty decent everything ate pretty good amazing definitely satisfyingwe also tried caramel pot de creme delicious tiny pot caramel pudding like stuff shortbread cookies side perfect dessert,yum place great food great service cute outdoor seating area back restaurant slightly covered great sunniness outdoors without overheatingi labor day weekend since sister visiting large party server really accommodating even split bill requested tried loco moco plus avocado chicken waffles burger chicken waffles good ive better ones elsewhere starbellys pretty decent everything ate pretty good amazing definitely satisfyingwe also tried caramel pot de creme delicious tiny pot caramel pudding like stuff shortbread cookies side perfect dessert,yum place great food great service cute outdoor seating area back restaurant slightly covered great sunniness outdoors without overheatingi labor day weekend since sister visiting large party server really accommodating even split bill requested tried loco moco plus avocado chicken waffle burger chicken waffle good ive better one elsewhere starbellys pretty decent everything ate pretty good amazing definitely satisfyingwe also tried caramel pot de creme delicious tiny pot caramel pudding like stuff shortbread cooky side perfect dessert,0.3387755102040816,0.6767573696145125
"I came here past 1pm to have lunch. I don't really like giving 3 stars or less just because I know how hard it is to run a restaurant. But during my visit, the place wasn't packed. They don't looked understaffed. The place is nicely decorated but service is inattentive, we only saw our server once (during order taking), we had to get someone's attention every time we needed help; from getting a table, ordering, paying our tab. The loco moco is very tasty with their sweet sauce, but it should not be called loco moco coz loco moco is about gravy. I was looking forward to try the gravy, but there was no gravy, it was this sweet sauce which is very tasty. I liked the dish, it's just I was really looking for gravy. The French Toast is sweeter than usual since they cover the entire top bread with strawberry jam, it would have been good if it has less jam so I can actually taste the flavor of the toast itself. The POBOY chicken sandwich is good. This is one of their best stuff.","i came here past 1pm to have lunch. i don't really like giving 3 stars or less just because i know how hard it is to run a restaurant. but during my visit, the place wasn't packed. they don't looked understaffed. the place is nicely decorated but service is inattentive, we only saw our server once (during order taking), we had to get someone's attention every time we needed help; from getting a table, ordering, paying our tab. the loco moco is very tasty with their sweet sauce, but it should not be called loco moco coz loco moco is about gravy. i was looking forward to try the gravy, but there was no gravy, it was this sweet sauce which is very tasty. i liked the dish, it's just i was really looking for gravy. the french toast is sweeter than usual since they cover the entire top bread with strawberry jam, it would have been good if it has less jam so i can actually taste the flavor of the toast itself. the poboy chicken sandwich is good. this is one of their best stuff.",i came here past 1pm to have lunch i dont really like giving 3 stars or less just because i know how hard it is to run a restaurant but during my visit the place wasnt packed they dont looked understaffed the place is nicely decorated but service is inattentive we only saw our server once during order taking we had to get someones attention every time we needed help from getting a table ordering paying our tab the loco moco is very tasty with their sweet sauce but it should not be called loco moco coz loco moco is about gravy i was looking forward to try the gravy but there was no gravy it was this sweet sauce which is very tasty i liked the dish its just i was really looking for gravy the french toast is sweeter than usual since they cover the entire top bread with strawberry jam it would have been good if it has less jam so i can actually taste the flavor of the toast itself the poboy chicken sandwich is good this is one of their best stuff,came past 1pm lunch dont really like giving 3 stars less know hard run restaurant visit place wasnt packed dont looked understaffed place nicely decorated service inattentive saw server order taking get someones attention every time needed help getting table ordering paying tab loco moco tasty sweet sauce called loco moco coz loco moco gravy looking forward try gravy gravy sweet sauce tasty liked dish really looking gravy french toast sweeter usual since cover entire top bread strawberry jam would good less jam actually taste flavor toast poboy chicken sandwich good one best stuff,past 1pm lunch dont really like giving 3 stars less know hard run restaurant visit place wasnt packed dont looked understaffed place nicely decorated service inattentive saw server order taking someones attention every time needed help getting table ordering paying tab loco moco tasty sweet sauce called loco moco coz loco moco gravy looking forward gravy gravy sweet sauce tasty liked dish really looking gravy french toast sweeter usual since cover entire top bread strawberry jam good less jam actually taste flavor toast poboy chicken sandwich good best stuff,past 1pm lunch dont really like giving 3 star le know hard run restaurant visit place wasnt packed dont looked understaffed place nicely decorated service inattentive saw server order taking someone attention every time needed help getting table ordering paying tab loco moco tasty sweet sauce called loco moco coz loco moco gravy looking forward gravy gravy sweet sauce tasty liked dish really looking gravy french toast sweeter usual since cover entire top bread strawberry jam good le jam actually taste flavor toast poboy chicken sandwich good best stuff,0.2240196078431372,0.48333333333333345
"This was my fourth time at Starbelly. We opted for a late brunch on Saturday this weekend. Our reservations were made in advance and we were seated as soon as we arrived.The seasonal corn and cilantro pizza had a delicious thin and crispy crust. With lime aioli drizzled on top, this pie is one of the best in SF. Our Starbelly Salad was fresh and toped with candy sweet cherry tomatoes and creamy goat cheese. A more generous portion of both was needed (we still had half a bowl of greens after we ate the fixings with the rest of the salad).The wait staff was almost too attentive. Within three minutes we were asked by three separate employees if they could take out plates. We were still working on our meals and would have appreciated better communication between the front of house team.","this was my fourth time at starbelly. we opted for a late brunch on saturday this weekend. our reservations were made in advance and we were seated as soon as we arrived.the seasonal corn and cilantro pizza had a delicious thin and crispy crust. with lime aioli drizzled on top, this pie is one of the best in sf. our starbelly salad was fresh and toped with candy sweet cherry tomatoes and creamy goat cheese. a more generous portion of both was needed (we still had half a bowl of greens after we ate the fixings with the rest of the salad).the wait staff was almost too attentive. within three minutes we were asked by three separate employees if they could take out plates. we were still working on our meals and would have appreciated better communication between the front of house team.",this was my fourth time at starbelly we opted for a late brunch on saturday this weekend our reservations were made in advance and we were seated as soon as we arrivedthe seasonal corn and cilantro pizza had a delicious thin and crispy crust with lime aioli drizzled on top this pie is one of the best in sf our starbelly salad was fresh and toped with candy sweet cherry tomatoes and creamy goat cheese a more generous portion of both was needed we still had half a bowl of greens after we ate the fixings with the rest of the saladthe wait staff was almost too attentive within three minutes we were asked by three separate employees if they could take out plates we were still working on our meals and would have appreciated better communication between the front of house team,fourth time starbelly opted late brunch saturday weekend reservations made advance seated soon arrivedthe seasonal corn cilantro pizza delicious thin crispy crust lime aioli drizzled top pie one best sf starbelly salad fresh toped candy sweet cherry tomatoes creamy goat cheese generous portion needed still half bowl greens ate fixings rest saladthe wait staff almost attentive within three minutes asked three separate employees could take plates still working meals would appreciated better communication front house team,fourth time starbelly opted late brunch saturday weekend reservations made advance seated soon arrivedthe seasonal corn cilantro pizza delicious thin crispy crust lime aioli drizzled top pie best sf starbelly salad fresh toped candy sweet cherry tomatoes creamy goat cheese generous portion needed still half bowl greens ate fixings rest saladthe wait staff almost attentive within three minutes asked three separate employees could take plates still working meals appreciated better communication front house team,fourth time starbelly opted late brunch saturday weekend reservation made advance seated soon arrivedthe seasonal corn cilantro pizza delicious thin crispy crust lime aioli drizzled top pie best sf starbelly salad fresh toped candy sweet cherry tomato creamy goat cheese generous portion needed still half bowl green ate fixing rest saladthe wait staff almost attentive within three minute asked three separate employee could take plate still working meal appreciated better communication front house team,0.24487179487179486,0.4897435897435898
"If I'm being honest, I liked the atmosphere here better than the food.

"An interesting thing happens when people ask for restaurant recommendations in the Castro:  They're steered away from Castro Street itself and you can see them pointing back down the street with a questioning look on their face saying ""nothing in that direction?""  Nothing in that direction.  Starbelly fills a void in the 'hood that's seemingly missing from Castro Street itself.  Brunch, lunch, and dinner are served 7-days per week (though not round-the-clock) in an upscale, ""now"" environment.  Think light wood furnishings, a menu written entirely in lower case font, and plates featuring Prather Ranch burgers, Little Gem salads, dishes with added aged-cheddar, and house-pickled jalapeños.  The fact that you recognize this menu as being from the time we live in is what distinguishes it from some other open-all day places directly on Castro.  At any time I'd say the place to dine here is the back patio.  In fact, for a recent weekday lunch I walked through an essentially empty restaurant to reach that attractive (and packed) al fresco spot.  On a beautiful day, everything will look better from here.  My waiter approached with big, full bottles of still and sparkling water and my table opted for both.  I was relieved to learn that there was no upsell here.  Even sparkling water, which they apparently carbonate themselves on-site, was provided free of charge. My salad (Bibb lettuce, grilled chicken, bacon, cherry tomatoes, & green goddess dressing, $13) was presented beautifully and was well-priced for a filling lunchtime meal in such an attractive setting.  Could the salad have benefited from crispier bacon and more ample and flavorful dressing?  It could have, but the fact that it didn't wasn't a dealbreaker.I think that Starbelly is a great (though far from recent) addition to the neighborhood: Good food, reasonable pricing, free and ample sparkling water.  When people ask, I will happily and confidently point them away from Castro

Came here for lunch today after not having been for years and it was terrible from start to finish.

"When I saw Starbelly's $15 lunch on the 2019 SF Restaurant Menu website, I thought it was a mistake. Once I arrived, however, I realized I was about to chow down on one of the week's best valued menus. AMBIANCE is lovely. I'm a huge fan of natural wood, and the space is full of it.  There's tables for 2-4 in the front of the restaurant, and bar seating available as well. From a glance, there's more seating in the back for larger parties (and outdoor seating as well). ORDERED House made chicken liver pate, fried chicken po' boy, salted caramel pot de creme with a cornmeal rosemary cookie ($15 total), and a delicious cocktail whose name I can't recall.FOOD was incredible. I loved the pate- probably the largest serving size I've received at a restaurant as well. The fried chicken sandwich was nice, light and crisp, and the pot de creme was the perfect way to end the meal.OVERALL Starbelly gets a filling four stars. Can't wait to come back and try their menu again soon!","when i saw starbelly's $15 lunch on the 2019 sf restaurant menu website, i thought it was a mistake. once i arrived, however, i realized i was about to chow down on one of the week's best valued menus. ambiance is lovely. i'm a huge fan of natural wood, and the space is full of it. there's tables for 2-4 in the front of the restaurant, and bar seating available as well. from a glance, there's more seating in the back for larger parties (and outdoor seating as well). ordered house made chicken liver pate, fried chicken po' boy, salted caramel pot de creme with a cornmeal rosemary cookie ($15 total), and a delicious cocktail whose name i can't recall.food was incredible. i loved the pate- probably the largest serving size i've received at a restaurant as well. the fried chicken sandwich was nice, light and crisp, and the pot de creme was the perfect way to end the meal.overall starbelly gets a filling four stars. can't wait to come back and try their menu again soon!",when i saw starbellys 15 lunch on the 2019 sf restaurant menu website i thought it was a mistake once i arrived however i realized i was about to chow down on one of the weeks best valued menus ambiance is lovely im a huge fan of natural wood and the space is full of it theres tables for 24 in the front of the restaurant and bar seating available as well from a glance theres more seating in the back for larger parties and outdoor seating as well ordered house made chicken liver pate fried chicken po boy salted caramel pot de creme with a cornmeal rosemary cookie 15 total and a delicious cocktail whose name i cant recallfood was incredible i loved the pate probably the largest serving size ive received at a restaurant as well the fried chicken sandwich was nice light and crisp and the pot de creme was the perfect way to end the mealoverall starbelly gets a filling four stars cant wait to come back and try their menu again soon,saw starbellys 15 lunch 2019 sf restaurant menu website thought mistake arrived however realized chow one weeks best valued menus ambiance lovely im huge fan natural wood space full theres tables 24 front restaurant bar seating available well glance theres seating back larger parties outdoor seating well ordered house made chicken liver pate fried chicken po boy salted caramel pot de creme cornmeal rosemary cookie 15 total delicious cocktail whose name cant recallfood incredible loved pate probably largest serving size ive received restaurant well fried chicken sandwich nice light crisp pot de creme perfect way end mealoverall starbelly gets filling four stars cant wait come back try menu soon,saw starbellys 15 lunch 2019 sf restaurant menu website thought mistake arrived however realized chow weeks best valued menus ambiance lovely huge fan natural wood space full theres tables 24 front restaurant bar seating available well glance theres seating back larger parties outdoor seating well ordered house made chicken liver pate fried chicken po boy salted caramel pot de creme cornmeal rosemary cookie 15 total delicious cocktail whose name cant recallfood incredible loved pate probably largest serving size ive received restaurant well fried chicken sandwich nice light crisp pot de creme perfect way end mealoverall starbelly gets filling four stars cant wait come back menu soon,saw starbellys 15 lunch 2019 sf restaurant menu website thought mistake arrived however realized chow week best valued menu ambiance lovely huge fan natural wood space full there table 24 front restaurant bar seating available well glance there seating back larger party outdoor seating well ordered house made chicken liver pate fried chicken po boy salted caramel pot de creme cornmeal rosemary cookie 15 total delicious cocktail whose name cant recallfood incredible loved pate probably largest serving size ive received restaurant well fried chicken sandwich nice light crisp pot de creme perfect way end mealoverall starbelly get filling four star cant wait come back menu soon,0.29,0.6608333333333333
"Starbelly brings all the boys to the yard.And they're like, it's better than yours.D**n right it's better than yours.They can teach you, but they have to charge.A particularly rainy evening brought my friend and I to this yard, specifically the back patio for some catching up over great food. I'd always eyed Starbelly in the many times I've been down to the 'Stro yet they escaped my mind after I stopped coming down here every weekend. Glad my friend suggested this place!We were seated and given menus by a particularly bubbly hostess. The back patio is quite nice with some viney foliage and nice shelter from an otherwise torrential rain (I've never lived in a tropical area so I imagine my depiction is a little over exaggerated). We had a nice little two seater which made for a very intimate conversation about all the trouble we'd been getting into. Even with the other diners talking rather loudly, we managed to be able to hear each other.The menu is smallish but I was able to zero in on some good vittles. I believe we settled on the Bread & Olive Oil to share which wasn't too filling, I appreciate that. My main however ended up being the Country style Italian sausage, soft polenta, sweet onions, peppers & tomato dish. Absolutely fresh and delicious as I expected it to be. I even ate it much slower than I usually do because I had a lot to say to my friend and he didn't need to be a recipient like a person in the front row of a Gallagher comedy show.All in all a great place that I want to come back to soon!!!","starbelly brings all the boys to the yard.and they're like, it's better than yours.d**n right it's better than yours.they can teach you, but they have to

"Visited this place while passing through on our way up to Napa. They were still serving their lunch/brunch menu. It was the middle of day, so it wasn't too busy! We opted for outdoor patio seating. Perfect day for outdoor dining at the time of visit. We ordered the Starbelly pizza which consisted of bacon, arugula, jalapeño and some green sauce on top. The pizza was tasty, gave it enough heat with the jalapeño. We also ordered the fried chicken po'boy sandwich. The slaw that came on it, was perfect. It's got heat, but not too much, as I can't handle heat as much as I used to...lol! Oh, this place was featured on Secret Eats with Adam Richman. They have an off the menu burger called Doc's Way Burger with bacon jam, chicken pâté. I would have ordered it, but was really craving pizza at the time.","visited this place while passing through on our way up to napa. they were still serving their lunch/brunch menu. it was the middle of day, so it wasn't too busy! we opted for outdoor patio seating. perfect day for outdoor dining at the time of visit. we ordered the starbelly pizza which consisted of bacon, arugula, jalapeño and some green sauce on top. the pizza was tasty, gave it enough heat with the jalapeño. we also ordered the fried chicken po'boy sandwich. the slaw that came on it, was perfect. it's got heat, but not too much, as i can't handle heat as much as i used to...lol! oh, this place was featured on secret eats with adam richman. they have an off the menu burger called doc's way burger with bacon jam, chicken pâté. i would have ordered it, but was really craving pizza at the time.",visited this place while passing through on our way up to napa they were still serving their lunchbrunch menu it was the middle of day so it wasnt too busy we opted for outdoor patio seating perfect day for outdoor dining at the time of visit we ordered the starbelly pizza which consisted of bacon arugula jalapeño and some green sauce on top the pizza was tasty gave it enough heat with the jalapeño we also ordered the fried chicken poboy sandwich the slaw that came on it was perfect its got heat but not too much as i cant handle heat as much as i used tolol oh this place was featured on secret eats with adam richman they have an off the menu burger called docs way burger with bacon jam chicken pâté i would have ordered it but was really craving pizza at the time,visited place passing way napa still serving lunchbrunch menu middle day wasnt busy opted outdoor patio seating perfect day outdoor dining time visit ordered starbelly pizza consisted bacon arugula jalapeño green sauce top pizza tasty gave enough heat jalapeño also ordered fried chicken poboy sandwich slaw came perfect got heat much cant handle heat much used tolol oh place featured secret eats adam richman menu burger called docs way burger bacon jam chicken pâté would ordered really craving pizza time,visited place passing way napa still serving lunchbrunch menu middle day wasnt busy opted outdoor patio seating perfect day outdoor dining time visit ordered starbelly pizza consisted bacon arugula jalapeño green sauce top pizza tasty gave enough heat jalapeño also ordered fried chicken poboy sandwich slaw perfect heat much cant handle heat much used tolol oh place featured secret eats adam richman menu burger called docs way burger bacon jam chicken pâté ordered really craving pizza time,visited place passing way napa still serving lunchbrunch menu middle day wasnt busy opted outdoor patio seating perfect day outdoor dining time visit ordered starbelly pizza consisted bacon arugula jalapeño green sauce top pizza tasty gave enough heat jalapeño also ordered fried chicken poboy sandwich slaw perfect heat much cant handle heat much used tolol oh place featured secret eats adam richman menu burger called doc way burger bacon jam chicken pâté ordered really craving pizza time,0.10769230769230774,0.5230769230769231
"Had to update my previous review given recent food quality for pick-up orders. I know we're all living in uncertain times, and I'm pretty flexible all things considered--however, the quality of lettuce in the Bibb Lettuce Salad (aka Butter Lettuce Salad) was pretty bad. I also asked for a well done burger, and ended up having to cook it for about 10m longer on a cast iron griddle once I got it home. I also didn't get my dipping sauces for a large order of cold fries either (and I live pretty close to the restaurant). Starbelly is usually up on food quality, including what you pay for & preferences for meat preparation (come on, it's a burger), but after my last two orders, this most recent one shown in my images especially, I will not be ordering anytime soon.","had to update my previous review given recent food quality for pick-up orders. i know we're all living in uncertain times, and i'm pretty flexible all things considered--however, the quality of lettuce in the bibb lettuce salad (aka butter lettuce salad) was pretty bad. i also asked for a well done burger, and ended up having to cook it for about 10m longer on a cast iron griddle once i got it home. i also didn't get my dipping sauces for a large order of cold fries either (and i live pretty close to the restaurant). starbelly is usually up on food quality, including what you pay for & preferences for meat preparation (come on, it's a burger), but after my last two orders, this most recent one shown in my images especially, i will not be ordering anytime soon.",had to update my previous review given recent food quality for pickup orders i know were all living in uncertain times and im pretty flexible all things consideredhowever the quality of lettuce in the bibb lettuce salad aka butter lettuce salad was pretty bad i also asked for a well done burger and ended up having to cook it for about 10m longer on a cast iron griddle once i got it home i also didnt get my dipping sauces for a large order of cold fries either and i live pretty close to the restaurant starbelly is usually up on food quality including what you pay for  preferences for meat preparation come on its a burger but after my last two orders this most recent one shown in my images especially i will not be ordering anytime soon,update previous review given recent food quality pickup orders know living uncertain times im pretty flexible things consideredhowever quality lettuce bibb lettuce salad aka butter lettuce salad pretty bad also asked well done burger ended cook 10m longer cast iron griddle got home also didnt get dipping sauces large order cold fries either live pretty close restaurant starbelly usually food quality including pay preferences meat preparation come burger last two orders recent one shown images especially ordering anytime soon,update previous review given recent food quality pickup orders know living uncertain times pretty flexible things consideredhowever quality lettuce bibb lettuce salad aka butter lettuce salad pretty bad also asked well done burger ended cook 10m longer cast iron griddle home also didnt dipping sauces large order cold fries either live pretty close restaurant starbelly usually food quality including pay preferences meat preparation come burger last two orders recent shown images especially ordering anytime soon,update previous review given recent food quality pickup order know living uncertain time pretty flexible thing consideredhowever quality lettuce bibb lettuce salad aka butter lettuce salad pretty bad also asked well done burger ended cook 10m longer cast iron griddle home also didnt dipping sauce large order cold fry either live pretty close restaurant starbelly usually food quality including pay preference meat preparation come burger last two order recent shown image especially ordering anytime soon,-0.04738594738594737,0.5829670329670329

"5/10 experience and would say that's generous. In the city you can find way tastier and kinder restaurants. The food was decent (nothing special) but what it really lacked was the service. Servers were inattentive -- had to ask for everything: to order, where the food was (long wait), water, to pay, etc and each time waiters seemed quite bothered and unkind. Overall just regret choosing this place, especially as a local taking visitors.","5/10 experience and would say that's generous. in the city you can find way tastier and kinder restaurants. the food was decent (nothing special) but what it really lacked was the service. servers were inattentive -- had to ask for everything: to order, where the food was (long wait), water, to pay, etc and each time waiters seemed quite bothered and unkind. overall just regret choosing this place, especially as a local taking visitors.",510 experience and would say thats generous in the city you can find way tastier and kinder restaurants the food was decent nothing special but what it really lacked was the service servers were inattentive  had to ask for everything to order where the food was long wait water to pay etc and each time waiters seemed quite bothered and unkind overall just regret choosing this place especially as a local taking visitors,510 experience would say thats generous city find way tastier kinder restaurants food decent nothing special really lacked service servers inattentive ask everything order food long wait water pay etc time waiters seemed quite bothered unkind overall regret choosing place especially local taking visitors,510 experience say thats generous city find way tastier kinder restaurants food decent nothing special really lacked service servers inattentive ask everything order food long wait water pay etc time waiters seemed quite bothered unkind overall regret choosing place especially local taking visitors,510 experience say thats generous city find way tastier kinder restaurant food decent nothing special really lacked service server inattentive ask everything order food long wait water pay etc time waiter seemed quite bothered unkind overall regret choosing place especially local taking visitor,0.1123015873015873,0.30634920634920637
"Let me start out by saying that this place is great for large groups with reservations online starting at  2 people and up. I've never had to endure the SF brunch starve here (where you wait so long you're either hangry or not hungry anymore), not even on a Saturday w/o reservation. ~Food~  This time - challah french toast: Oooo yum. I usually get an egg based brunch but the table next to me was chowing down on some french toast and I had to go with my gut. Thick fluffy challah toast with a generous dollop of fromage (which tasted like cream cheese + soft butter), homemade strawberry jam (perfect balance of sour and sweet), and some sprinkles of chopped up pistachios that completed the whole taste.sunnyside joe's: Food lava served on a mini sizzling pan. It's a combo of ground beef, spinach, cheese, and runny eggs. It's a hot mess so make sure you poke at it with your fork before you take the first bite. I've figured out that dipping the potatoes in it like it's a french onion dip is the best way to go. Another good combo of ingredients but I wish it came with toasted levain instead of potatoes as that would've been great to dip/spread with. Previous times - 2 farmhouse eggs: your standard breakfast plate, good but nothing crazycornmeal crusted fish tacos: already comes with a generous side salad (or you can sub for the starbelly salad for extra $), they're loaded tacos so be ready to get your hands dirty, fish was good and the spicy slaw gave it an extra kickStarbelly pizza: the pizza was a little underwhelming. It's a thin crust but it was limp, not crunchy. The arugula kind of just fell off of the pizza when you picked up a slice. Flavor was alright but the texture just really turned me off. ~Price/Quality/Quantity~  Brunch price here is on the lower side of the SF brunch scale. I would argue that it's because the portions are also slightly smaller, depending on the plate. For example the loco moco is $11 and it's the smallest plate out of the ""eggs"" section. ~Atmosphere/Service~On the outside, this place is tucked away from Market St with a tiny sign. But once you enter, it's open, airy, and hipster. They have a full bar indoors at the front of the restaurant for all you brunch alcoholics. The back has a covered/greenhouse style patio with seating for large groups. You can get a picnic experience without all the wind, heat, and flies. ~Bottom Line~Underrated brunch, interesting fusions, and perfect for groups.","let me start out by saying that this place is

arugula kind of just fell off of the pizza when you picked up a slice flavor was alright but the texture just really turned me off pricequalityquantity brunch price here is on the lower side of the sf

"This restaurant reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, Herb and Biter. I loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant, and really liked the backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating area.I made reservations for 3 just to ensure we got a table, and did so only a few hours in advance. I got the time that I was hoping for. It got pretty busy with many walk-in's (we were near the front so I could easily see and hear), so if and when I go back I will make reservations again. That being said, I think you could be seated with little wait if you did not make a reservation.I ordered the margarita pizza and added chorizo, and I'm glad I did because it would have been a little underwhelming if I hadn't. The pizza had good flavor and I really liked the basil? which is weird because who says that, but it was memorable. The service was great! Our server was funny and helpful throughout the meal.My friends got the steak and the burger and they both really enjoyed their meals as well!","this restaurant reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in seattle, herb and biter. i loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant, and really liked the backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating area.i made reservations for 3 just to ensure we got a table, and did so only a few hours in advance. i got the time that i was hoping for. it got pretty busy with many walk-in's (we were near the front so i could easily see and hear), so if and when i go back i will make reservations again. that being said, i think you could be seated with little wait if you did not make a reservation.i ordered the margarita pizza and added chorizo, and i'm glad i did because it would have been a little underwhelming if i hadn't. the pizza had good flavor and i really liked the basil? which is weird because who says that, but it was memorable. the service was great! our server was funny and helpful throughout the meal.my friends got the steak and the burger and they both really enjoyed their meals as well!",this restaurant reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in seattle herb and biter i loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and really liked the backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating areai made reservations for 3 just to ensure we got a table and did so only a few hours in advance i got the time that i was hoping for it got pretty busy with many walkins we were near the front so i could easily see and hear so if and when i go back i will make reservations again that being said i think you could be seated with little wait if you did not make a reservationi ordered the margarita pizza and added chorizo and im glad i did because it would have been a little underwhelming if i hadnt the pizza had good flavor and i really liked the basil which is weird because who says that but it was memorable the service was great our server was funny and helpful throughout the mealmy friends got the steak and the burger and they both really enjoyed their meals as well,restaurant reminded one favorite restaurants seattle herb biter loved atmosphere decor restaurant really liked backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating areai made reservations 3 ensure got table hours advance got time hoping got pretty busy many walkins near front could easily see hear go back make reservations said think could seated little wait make reservationi ordered margarita pizza added chorizo im glad would little underwhelming hadnt pizza good flavor really liked basil weird says memorable service great server funny helpful throughout mealmy friends got steak burger really enjoyed meals well,restaurant reminded favorite restaurants seattle herb biter loved atmosphere decor restaurant really liked backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating areai made reservations 3 ensure table hours advance time hoping pretty busy many walkins near front could easily see hear back make reservations said think could seated little wait make reservationi ordered margarita pizza added chorizo glad little underwhelming hadnt pizza good flavor really liked basil weird says memorable service great server funny helpful throughout mealmy friends steak burger really enjoyed meals well,restaurant reminded favorite restaurant seattle herb biter loved atmosphere decor restaurant really liked back outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating areai made reservation 3 ensure table hour advance time hoping pretty busy many walkins near front could easily see hear back make reservation said think could seated little wait make reservationi ordered margarita pizza added chorizo glad little underwhelming hadnt pizza good flavor really liked basil weird say memorable service great server funny helpful throughout mealmy friend steak burger really enjoyed meal well,0.30791666666666667,0.6741666666666667
"A GREAT hip brunch place in Castro!I love Starbelly! I came here for brunch and there was about an hour wait. We decided to wait and walked around Castro. I'm so glad that I waited because it was worth the wait! We ordered chicken&waffle, starbelly pizza and Prather's ranch skillet breakfast. The portion was more than enough for three ppl. Chicken and waffle was average. I think it's because I prefer crispy waffle but chicken was decent!  BUT their pizza and that skillet breakfast were sooo good! It seemed like every table has at least one of these! Pizza was amazing! Thin crust, generous amount of arugula with kick of jalapeños! I'd definitely get it next time maybe different flavor because I don't want to miss out! The service was outstanding. I accidentally left my to-go box there and one of staff ran outside to get me and hand me the box. That was so nice of them! Outstanding service, decent food and good vibes! I'd like to come here for dinner next time! Highly recommend it!","a great hip brunch place in castro!i love starbelly! i came here for brunch and there was about an hour wait. we decided to wait and walked around castro. i'm so glad that i waited because it was worth the wait! we ordered chicken&waffle, starbelly pizza and prather's ranch skillet breakfast. the portion was more than enough for three ppl. chicken and waffle was average. i think it's because i prefer crispy waffle but chicken was decent! but their pizza and that skillet breakfast were sooo good! it seemed like every table has at least one of these! pizza was amazing! thin crust, generous amount of arugula with kick of jalapeños! i'd definitely get it next time maybe different flavor because i don't want to miss out! the service was outstanding. i accidentally left my to-go box there and one of staff ran outside to get me and hand me the box. that was so nice of them! outstanding service, decent food and good vibes! i'd like to come here for dinner next time! highly recommend it!",a great hip brunch place in castroi love starbelly i came here for brunch and there was about an hour wait we decided to wait and walked around castro im so glad that i waited because it was worth the wait we ordered chickenwaffle starbelly pizza and prathers ranch skillet breakfast the portion was more than enough for three ppl chicken and waffle was average i think its because i prefer crispy waffle but chicken was decent but their pizza and that skillet breakfast were sooo good it seemed like every table has at least one of these pizza was amazing thin crust generous amount of arugula with kick of jalapeños id definitely get it next time maybe different flavor because i dont want to miss out the service was outstanding i accidentally left my togo box there and one of staff ran outside to get me and hand me the box that was so nice of them outstanding service decent food and good vibes id like to come here for dinner next time highly recommend it,great hip brunch place castroi love starbelly came brunch hour wait decided wait walked around castro im glad waited worth wait ordered chickenwaffle starbelly pizza prathers ranch skillet breakfast portion enough three ppl chicken waffle average think prefer crispy waffle chicken decent pizza skillet breakfast sooo good seemed like every table least one pizza amazing thin crust generous amount arugula kick jalapeños id definitely get next time maybe different flavor dont want miss service outstanding accidentally left togo box one staff ran outside get hand box nice outstanding service decent food good vibes id like come dinner next time highly recommend,great hip brunch place castroi love starbelly brunch hour wait decided wait walked around castro glad waited worth wait ordered chickenwaffle starbelly pizza prathers ranch skillet breakfast portion enough three ppl chicken waffle average think prefer crispy waffle chicken decent pizza skillet breakfast sooo good seemed like every table least pizza amazing thin crust generous amount arugula kick jalapeños id definitely next time maybe different flavor dont want miss service outstanding accidentally left togo box staff ran outside hand box nice outstanding service decent food good vibes id like come dinner next time highly recommend,great hip brunch place castroi love starbelly brunch hour wait decided wait walked around castro glad waited worth wait ordered chickenwaffle starbelly pizza prathers ranch skillet breakfast portion enough three ppl chicken waffle average think prefer crispy waffle chicken decent pizza skillet breakfast sooo good seemed like every table least pizza amazing thin crust generous amount arugula kick jalapeños id definitely next time maybe different flavor dont want miss service outstanding accidentally left togo box staff ran outside hand box nice outstanding service decent food good vibe id like come dinner next time highly recommend,0.1726388888888889,0.5780555555555555

"Went for brunch ordered the chilaquiles and i received it and asked for extra salsa on the side assuming that there was some already on the food but the server said they don't have salsa. So i proceeded to taste it very bland and boring. Not the  chilaquiles i was expecting to get. And the container our water was in had black specks in it. And so we told another employee after we had paid about the food, waited for our Lyft and the server came out and was very hostile and rude to us stating that if we didn't like the food we should've said something and it's very rude towards them and proceeded to flip us off. Mind you he said it with attitude and aggression while i didn't say a word. I paid my tab and still tipped. Tab was expensive and not worth the price. Very unprofessional and rude. Will not return.

"Taste: 4.5Value: 3.5Note to world: many SF restaurant week deals, particularly lunch deals, appear to only be running on the weekend. It would be really helpful if restaurants posted that somewhere in their many advertisements of these promotions, especially if they're ONLY running a lunch special.To our disappointment, we arrived and found that out. Luckily, we didn't wait at all since we made a reservation on open table. And since we found good parking very closeby, we decided to try the brunch. Loco moco was just about the smallest brunch plate I have ever seen. A single patty on top of plain white rice with a sunny side egg. The marinade was some sort of sweet teriyaki and was nothing short of amazing, but not sure I would get this again. We also had the sunny side jo which is the ground beef patty (less flavorful than the loco moco one) in a bed of spinach and onions under two eggs. Potatoes too. A better value comparatively speaking. Service was quick but I almost felt rushed in trying to figure out my order as fast as he kept coming back to check in.

"I don't understand how this place gets any more than 2 stars, especially in SF. We ordered:- Chicken pâté (Good, flavorful)- Salumi platter (Just okay, nothing special)- French fries (All soggy, not a single crispy fry and sauces were meh)- Bacon pizza (The entire middle of this pizza came out soggy and wet, pretty much disintegrating the crust in the middle/bottom)- Steak with yucca fries (Probably one of the worst, chewiest, inedible, steaks I've ever had. Flavorless, and couldn't even finish one slice. The yucca fries should be called yucky fries. They were as dry as bark. We regret not sending it back.)- Bacon jalapeño spaghetti (My favorite dish of the night - the noodle texture and sauce flavor was delicious, and the jalapeño kick was perfect. The only issue with this one was the several hard pieces of bacon in the dish) - White sangria (Even this was so bland!)In short, I really regret wasting my money here and I am truly confused why people like this place.

"My first time having brunch here was a delight.  There were so many things on the menu that I had a hard time deciding what to have.  I didn't pause though on the Strawberry Alarm Clock cocktail.  Mmmmm, that was good!My husband went with the loco moco, which I was thinking about.  He then strongly suggested the chicken and waffles, I'm guessing more because he wanted to try it.  I mean, I love chicken and waffles too, but I really needed to change up my brunch game.  I decided on the chilaquiles, which I haven't had in a long time.  Our server was very friendly and when I asked to add an egg, she mistakenly said the chilaquiles came with it.  When my dish came out without it, she was right there to admit that it was her first day and she was still getting used to the menu and being on her own.  No worries, she quickly placed an order for my eggs and it came out quickly to add with my dish.  The chilaquiles was good both with and without the egg and I'd probably make a trip here if I'm ever in the mood for it again.  I only got a small bite of the loco moco, which means it was probably really good since my husband ate it so quickly.Going early was great as we got a table right away and didn't have to deal with the brunch crowd that gathered as we were leaving.  I'm looking forward to another trip to Starbelly, especially hoping we get the same server as she was so nice on her first day.","my first time having brunch here was a delight. there were so many things on the menu that i had a hard time deciding what to have. i didn't pause though on the strawberry

try it. i mean, i love chicken and waffles too, but i really needed to change up my brunch game. i decided on the chilaquiles, which i haven't had in a long time. our server was very friendly and when i asked to add an egg, she mistakenly said the chilaquiles came with it. when my dish came out without it, she was right there to admit that it was her first day and she was still getting used to the menu and being on her own. no worries, she quickly placed an order for my eggs and it came out quickly to add with my dish. the chilaquiles was good both with and without the egg and i'd probably make a trip here if i'm ever in the mood for it again. i only got a small bite of the loco moco, which means it was probably really good since my husband ate it so quickly.going early was great as we got a table right away and didn't have to deal with the brunch crowd that gathered as we were leaving. i'm looking forward to another trip to starbelly, especially hoping we get the same server as she was

"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in SF. We came for my boyfriend's birthday last night in a party of 6 and from the first moment we spoke to the hostess, she was extremely rude and curt with us and seemed to consistently berate us for being 10 mins late even though the table wasn't even ready after our party had arrived. They also told us we had only 90 mins to eat but then did not bring us our 2nd course of food until 75 mins into the dinner so we had to rush to eat. The hostess/waitress consistently berated is throughout the evening. Wished I read the previous reviews about service here. Really don't understand why they would treat people this way especially since this was for a birthday celebration. Called the manager to calmly explained the situation, but it was the same attitude. Highly do not recommend and will not be coming back.","one of the worst dining experiences i've had in sf. we came for my boyfriend's birthday last night in a party of 6 and from the first moment we spoke to the hostess, she was extremely rude and curt with us and seemed to consistently berate us for being 10 mins late even though the table wasn't even ready after our party had arrived. they also told us we had only 90 mins to eat but then did not bring us our 2nd course of food until 75 mins into the dinner so we had to rush to eat. the hostess/waitress consistently berated is throughout the evening. wished i read the previous reviews about service here. really don't understand why they would treat people this way especially since this was for a birthday celebration. called the manager to calmly explained the situation, but it was the same attitude. highly do not recommend and will not be coming back.",one of the worst dining experiences ive had in sf we came for my boyfriends birthday last night in a party of 6 and from the first moment we spoke to the hostess she was extremely rude and curt with us and seemed to consistently berate us for being 10 mins late even though the table wasnt even ready after our party had arrived they also told us we had only 90 mins to eat but then did not bring us our 2nd course of food until 75 mins into the dinner so we had to rush to eat the hostesswaitress consistently berated is throughout the evening wished i read the previous reviews about service here really dont understand why they would treat people this way especially since this was for a birthday celebration called the manager to calmly explained the situation but it was the same attitude highly do not recommend and will not be coming back,one worst dining experiences ive sf came boyfriends birthday last night party 6 first moment spoke hostess extremely rude curt us seemed consistently berate us 10 mins late even though table wasnt even ready party arrived also told us 90 mins eat bring us 2nd course food 75 mins dinner rush eat hostesswaitress consistently berated throughout evening wished read previous reviews service really dont understand would treat people way especially since birthday celebration called manager calmly explained situation attitude highly recommend coming back,worst dining experiences ive sf boyfriends birthday last night party 6 first moment spoke hostess extremely rude curt seemed consistently berate 10 mins late even though table wasnt even ready party arrived also told 90 mins eat bring 2nd course food 75 mins dinner rush eat hostesswaitress consistently berated throughout evening wished read previous reviews service really dont understand treat people way especially since birthday celebration called manager calmly explained situation attitude highly recommend coming back,worst dining experience ive sf boyfriend birthday last night party 6 first moment spoke hostess extremely rude curt seemed consistently berate 10 min late even though table wasnt even ready party arrived also told 90 min eat bring 2nd course food 75 min dinner rush eat hostesswaitress consistently berated throughout evening wished read previous review service really dont understand treat people way especially since birthday celebration called manager calmly explained situation attitude highly recommend coming back,-0.010444444444444444,0.4171111111111111

"I got here on a Monday right around noon and it was pretty empty, or maybe everyone was in the back, but I got seated immediately for two. The vibe is unassuming and quite nice. Service was quick right at the beginning, but when we needed to look the menu over a bit longer, it felt like we were forgotten about for a while and had to actively wave someone down to order. I ordered the chilaquiles. It was served with a side house salad which was good as a side. Simple, and easy. The chilaquiles were quite good. A nice crunch a covered in flavor, though I did kinda want more sour cream everywhere or maybe a lime as it could've used a bit more acidity. Still quite good. I had a taste of my friend's Loco moco and it was a very interesting play on the Hawaiian dish. The sauce (usually gravy) was light and tangy. It caught me off guard, so I'm not sure if I really liked the variation. Honestly the burger patty wasn't that impressive either. All in all, a good experience. Not the best brunch in town, but at least the food was sold and there was no wait at all.","i got here on a monday right around noon and it was pretty empty, or maybe everyone was in the back, but i got seated immediately for two. the vibe is unassuming and quite nice. service was quick right at the beginning, but when we needed to look the menu over a bit longer, it felt like we were forgotten about for a while and had to actively wave someone down to order. i ordered the chilaquiles. it was served with a side house salad which was good as a side. simple, and easy. the chilaquiles were quite good. a nice crunch a covered in flavor, though i did kinda want more sour cream everywhere or maybe a lime as it could've used a bit more acidity. still quite good. i had a taste of my friend's loco moco and it was a very interesting play on the hawaiian dish. the sauce (usually gravy) was light and tangy. it caught me off guard, so i'm not sure if i really liked the variation. honestly the burger patty wasn't that impressive either. all in all, a good experience. not the best brunch in town, but at least the food was sold and there was no wait at all.",i got here on a monday right around noon and it was pretty empty or maybe everyone was in the back but i got seated immediately for two the vibe is unassuming and quite nice service was quick right at the beginning but when we needed to look the menu over a bit longer it felt like we were forgotten about for a while and had to actively wave someone down to order i ordered the chilaquiles it was served with a side house salad which was good as a side simple and easy the chilaquiles were quite good a nice crunch a covered in flavor though i did kinda want more sour cream everywhere or maybe a lime as it couldve used a bit more acidity still quite good i had a taste of my friends loco moco and it was a very interesting play on the hawaiian dish the sauce usually gravy was light and tangy it caught me off guard so im not sure if i really liked the variation honestly the burger patty wasnt that impressive either all in all a good experience not the best brunch in town but at least the food was sold and there was no wait at all,got monday right around noon pretty empty maybe everyone back got seated immediately two vibe unassuming quite nice service quick right beginning needed look menu bit longer felt like forgotten actively wave someone order ordered chilaquiles served side house salad good side simple easy chilaquiles quite good nice crunch covered flavor though kinda want sour cream everywhere maybe lime couldve used bit acidity still quite good taste friends loco moco interesting play hawaiian dish sauce usually gravy light tangy caught guard im sure really liked variation honestly burger patty wasnt impressive either good experience best brunch town least food sold wait,monday right around noon pretty empty maybe everyone back seated immediately two vibe unassuming quite nice service quick right beginning needed look menu bit longer felt like forgotten actively wave someone order ordered chilaquiles served side house salad good side simple easy chilaquiles quite good nice crunch covered flavor though kinda want sour cream everywhere maybe lime couldve used bit acidity still quite good taste friends loco moco interesting play hawaiian dish sauce usually gravy light tangy caught guard sure really liked variation honestly burger patty wasnt impressive either good experience best brunch town least food sold wait,monday right around noon pretty empty maybe everyone back seated immediately two vibe unassuming quite nice service quick right beginning needed look menu bit longer felt like forgotten actively wave someone order ordered chilaquiles served side house salad good side simple easy chilaquiles quite good nice crunch covered flavor though kinda want sour cream everywhere maybe lime couldve used bit acidity still quite good taste friend loco moco interesting play hawaiian dish sauce usually gravy light tangy caught guard sure really liked variation honestly burger patty wasnt impressive either good experience best brunch town least food sold wait,0.3701904761904762,0.604031746031746

"I really didn't want to post this, but I was a patron the same evening as Kris and Faith and witnessed the entire conversation.  We were the two Asian guys at the table closest to the wall behind Faith.I, too, am a person of color and while I can empathize about what it's like to be racially profiled and singled out, to be fair, they were informing the table of four next to you quite often also. That table of four also wasn't all white. While I will stand up to injustices, we also have to acknowledge and take responsibility for our own actions. There are signs all over the restaurant stating that one must wear masks at all times. There was even an ordinance that was implemented stating 'unless your fork is on its way to your mouth OR the cup is about to hit your lips, your masks have to be on.' Well, that isn't verbatim to the ordinance, but I'm sure you get it. We didn't get spoken to at all about our masks because we followed the rules. So much so that instead of re-hooking my ear the forty times I did (that's over exaggerated) with the band, I wiped my mouth and held my mask over my face to chew and talk. It's called compassion. These employees are literally risking their health and safety to feed you. The least we can do as a community is take care of them as they do the same for us.To be a service worker having to implement these rules must be uncomfortable. I'm also making an assumption here regarding that but I know it would be for me because I have to do the same working in healthcare. So if I can make a recommendation, have some compassion and follow the rules. And trust, I get it. We all want to eat out and enjoy our meals, but laughing loudly without a mask on is like sneezing without covering your mouth; the spit can still fly everywhere and we can all be at risk.Be responsible and take care of each other during this time. This world needs more of it right now.And a big thank you to ALL the service workers. I appreciate you.  And really, what can I say about the food? The food has always been consistent. My favorite item is the pate. I like getting extra bread because the pate piece is always huge! Also, that evening we got the fries, Brussels sprouts, dumplings, pizza, steak, salmon, and two creme de pots. All of which again, were tasty. Did I mention it was just two of us? We like to eat and I look forward to dinner there again soon.","i really didn't want to post this, but i was a patron the same evening as kris and faith and witnessed the entire conversation. we were

"I came to Starbelly recently with my brother and his friends for brunch.  I think it is located near or in the Castro (don't hate the visitor....lol). Our party was immediately seated upon entering.  We were seated in the entrance area.  There appears to be a larger seating area in the back which looks good for larger groups (I.e more than 6 individuals). The brunch menu to me looked a little small for choices to choose from.  However, they did have fried chicken and waffles and a Hawaiian loco moco.  My LA side wanted me to order the fried chicken and waffles.  My Hawaiian side wanted me to order the loco moco.   Was a tough choice.   I ended up ordering the loco moco.   For those who have not had a loco moco before, it is a beef patty with egg and gravy over rice.  In Hawaii, it is a big dish.   Starfish's version was not.   The loco moco had all the elements to make it except it was only with one scoop rice and one egg.  I am accustom to 2 scoops rice and 2 eggs which is the norm in Hawaii.   Thus, my expectations got the best of me.  The beef patty was cooked well as I ordered it and my egg was sunny side up.   It was good, but it can't beat the original from Hawaii.    I was chatting to the lady next to me and she ordered the chicken and waffles.   She said it was good.  It consisted of deep friend lightly breaded chicken breasts served with 2 waffles.   It looked good and I wanted to take a pic of it but felt awkward since it would be disturbing her while she was eating. The service here is good.   I will give them credit for customer service as one of our parties order did not arrive with the rest of the orders and came out late.  They comped their mistake.   The drinks looked good here.","i came to starbelly recently with my brother and his friends for brunch. i think it is located near or in the castro (don't hate the visitor....lol). our party was

"I've been dining at Starbelly for over 5 years and every time I go, it's always consistent and good. The menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other San Francisco restaurants. With that said, I suggest ordering the Loco Moco. It's a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy, yet comfortable. The pizzas at Starbelly are fantastic as well. If you are going for brunch, I suggest the Chorizo and sunny egg. It makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch. Their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced. Nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food!","i've been dining at starbelly for over 5 years and every time i go, it's always consistent and good. the menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other san francisco restaurants. with that said, i suggest ordering the loco moco. it's a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy, yet comfortable. the pizzas at starbelly are fantastic as well. if you are going for brunch, i suggest the chorizo and sunny egg. it makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch. their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced. nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food!",ive been dining at starbelly for over 5 years and every time i go its always consistent and good the menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other san francisco restaurants with that said i suggest ordering the loco moco its a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy yet comfortable the pizzas at starbelly are fantastic as well if you are going for brunch i suggest the chorizo and sunny egg it makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food,ive dining starbelly 5 years every time go always consistent good menu unique eclectic scratching head wondering ordered unlike many san francisco restaurants said suggest ordering loco moco perfect entrée looking something hardy yet comfortable pizzas starbelly fantastic well going brunch suggest chorizo sunny egg makes unique take pizza taste like breakfast brunch drink list also delightful reasonably priced nothing beats fun sparkling rosé tasty cocktail fantastic food,ive dining starbelly 5 years every time always consistent good menu unique eclectic scratching head wondering ordered unlike many san francisco restaurants said suggest ordering loco moco perfect entrée looking something hardy yet comfortable pizzas starbelly fantastic well going brunch suggest chorizo sunny egg makes unique take pizza taste like breakfast brunch drink list also delightful reasonably priced nothing beats fun sparkling rosé tasty cocktail fantastic food,ive dining starbelly 5 year every time always consistent good menu unique eclectic scratching head wondering ordered unlike many san francisco restaurant said suggest ordering loco moco perfect entrée looking something hardy yet comfortable pizza starbelly fantastic well going brunch suggest chorizo sunny egg make unique take pizza taste like breakfast brunch drink list also delightful reasonably priced nothing beat fun sparkling rosé tasty cocktail fantastic food,0.4916666666666667,0.7291666666666666
"Tucked away in the Mission is this little place.  It's less than a mile away from 16th St. Bart.  Several of us were going to get dinner together and we were a party of seven.  It was chilly that day and we were seated in the very back in the tented area.  Fortunately, there were blaring heat lamps that made it very warm and comfy.  I even had to take off several layers.  This restaurant is a little cramped, but by extending it using the bungalow-type arrangement, it increases space by a ton. It has a cute, classy, yet organic pub feel - very SF. I ordered the Timberline to start and it was delicious and topped with rosemary.  Because I had eaten a late lunch, I decided to order the mussels.  Though it's an appetizer, it's pretty large (but still smaller than a main entrée). It is pan fried and cooked with chorizo, which flavored the dish oh so well.  It was the perfect amount for me.  I also tried some of Boyfriends steak.  It was so soft and delicious.  Definitely would recommend (though it's a little pricy).  The pizza that some others had gotten was large, but had a very thin crust (think pieology thin). Don't have any complains really.  We did notice that the heat lamps got to be a bit too warm, but I would rather that than be too cold. Very cute place! Definitely would want to try to come back if I'm in the area and I would recommend to friends.Ambiance: 4/5Food and Drink: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Overall Experience: 4/5","tucked away in the mission is this little place. it's less than a mile away from 16th st. bart. several of us were going to get dinner together and we were a party of seven. it was chilly that day and we were seated in the very back in the tented area. fortunately, there were blaring heat lamps that made it very warm and comfy. i even had to take off several layers. this restaurant is a little cramped, but by extending it using the bungalow-type arrangement, it increases space by a ton. it has a cute, classy, yet organic pub feel - very sf. i ordered the timberline to start and it was delicious and topped with rosemary. because i had eaten a late lunch, i decided to order the mussels. though it's an appetizer, it's pretty large (but still smaller than a main entrée). it is pan fried and cooked with chorizo, which flavored the dish oh so well. it was the perfect amount for me. i also tried some of boyfriends steak. it was so soft and delicious. definitely would recommend (though it's a little pricy). the pizza that some others had gotten was large, but had a very thin crust (think pieology thin). don't have any complains really. we did notice that the heat lamps got to be a bit too warm, but i would rather that than be too cold. very cute place!

"Starbelly has long been a beloved brunch spot for me, and today we came for dinner with some friends, our toddler, and our baby. It was such a wonderful dining experience all around. Setting: We ate on the covered, cozy lit, and heated patio, which was perfect for a brisk SF evening. Service: The staff was friendly as always, though I especially appreciated them tonight with our kiddos. The adults in our party were taking a while deciding (everything looked delish!), and the manager went out of his way to take our toddler's order first to get it started. Her order was ready before the rest of us even finished ordering and probably saved us from a hangry meltdown. They were also great about helping us find a good spot for our stroller, and generally just made all of us at ease. Food: So good, per usual. Our small group went family-style on a bunch of things: (going from fav to less memorable)* Halibut: Each component of the dish was fresh and well tended to. The crisp yet tender halibut was a winner. * Spaghetti: My toddler's order, but all the adults loved it too. Super flavorful, perfectly done noodles, and huge hunks of bacon.* Burrata + grilled stonefruit: SO good. The mix of textures and flavors was wonderful. I could eat this every day.* Italian sausage + polenta: I'm not a sausage person, but my dinner mates really enjoyed it.* Starbelly salad: A nice compliment to everything above, with super fresh ingredients, but otherwise a pretty basic salad.  * Mussels: The sauce and the bread were great, but the mussels themselves were overcooked and shriveled. Our happy hour drinks were also great, esp. for the price (my yummy pint of lager was $5!)Love the friendly vibe, welcoming staff, cozy (yet airy) space, and delicious food.","starbelly has long been

Yet they want my family to eat their food WITH their mask on at the same time. Does that make any sense?And also, I got to try the food and it tasted like absolute shit.

"Asian racism is alive and well at Starbelly....how is that possible???? Ate there tonight with my sister from Hawai'i and we were the only 2 people there who were constantly harassed about wearing a mask...even during dinner service.  The white 4 top next to us along with the white 2 top to our right, were all NOT wearing masks during dinner service.  But they were never asked to put one on, just the two of us.  When I raised my hand and made a case as to why they weren't asked to wear a mask after 10 minutes of observing in silence, the manager came over and said  ""some people just don't listen"".  So I asked him ""so then why are you at our table and not theirs??"".  We paid a $130 tab for the two of us so you know we were not there to just sit and absorb space.  But after this incident, I'd challenge any person of color who truly cares about racial and social injustice to think twice about funding a restaurant who will willfully treat people this way in during these sensitive times.","asian racism is alive and well at starbelly....how is that possible???? ate there tonight with my sister from hawai'i and we were the only 2 people there who were constantly harassed about wearing a mask...even during dinner service. the white 4 top next to us along with the white 2 top to our right, were all not wearing masks during dinner service. but they were never asked to put one on, just the two of us. when i raised my hand and made a case as to why they weren't asked to wear a mask after 10 minutes of observing in silence, the manager came over and said ""some people just don't listen"". so i asked him ""so then why are you at our table and not theirs??"". we paid a $130 tab for the two of us so you know we were not there to just sit and absorb space. but after this incident, i'd challenge any person of color who truly cares about racial and social injustice to think twice about funding a restaurant who will willfully treat people this way in during these sensitive times.",asian racism is alive and well at starbellyhow is that possible ate there tonight with my sister from hawaii and we were the only 2 people there who were constantly harassed about wearing a maskeven during dinner service the white 4 top next to us along with the white 2 top to our right were all not wearing masks during dinner service but they were never asked to put one on just the two of us when i raised my hand and made a case as to why they werent asked to wear a mask after 10 minutes of observing in silence the manager came over and said some people just dont listen so i asked him so then why are you at our table and not theirs we paid a 130 tab for the two of us so you know we were not there to just sit and absorb space but after this incident id challenge any person of color who truly cares about racial and social injustice to think twice about funding a restaurant who will willfully treat people this way in during these sensitive times,asian racism alive well starbellyhow possible ate tonight sister hawaii 2 people constantly harassed wearing maskeven dinner service white 4 top next us along white 2 top right wearing masks dinner service never asked put one two us raised hand made case werent asked wear mask 10 minutes observing silence manager came said people dont listen asked table paid 130 tab two us know sit absorb space incident id challenge person color truly cares racial social injustice think twice funding restaurant willfully treat people way sensitive times,asian racism alive well starbellyhow possible ate tonight sister hawaii 2 people constantly harassed wearing maskeven dinner service white 4 top next along white 2 top right wearing masks dinner service never asked put two raised hand made case werent asked wear mask 10 minutes observing silence manager said people dont listen asked table paid 130 tab two know sit absorb space incident id challenge person color truly cares racial social injustice think twice funding restaurant willfully treat people way sensitive times,asian racism alive well starbellyhow possible ate tonight sister hawaii 2 people constantly harassed wearing maskeven dinner service white 4 top next along white 2 top right wearing mask dinner service never asked put two raised hand made case werent asked wear mask 10 minute observing silence manager said people dont listen asked table paid 130 tab two know sit absorb space incident id challenge person color truly care racial social injustice think twice funding restaurant willfully treat people way sensitive time,0.1265873015873016,0.3529761904761905
"STAY AWAY!!! Deceptive business practice and horrible management!!  I'm seated here now at 12:30 pm on Sunday (1/27) for Restaurant Week, but they  are absolutely refusing to honor the Restaurant Week price THEY are advertising!!! I spoke directly to the manager (Ian) who flippantly admitted that it was an error on THEIR part that there is absolutely no indication anywhere that their Restaurant Week menu is only being offered on the weekdays.  He said  it was brought to his attention yesterday, by a couple of customers.  He apologized, but was adamant and said there was absolutely no way he could make an exception. He said he could serve the items from the Restaurant Week menu, but only at the regular price. Seriously? The special menu was for a measly $15.00 per person. I guess they obviously feel $15.00 isn't worth their reputation. Ok, I learned my lesson about how this place is managed and hope you'll learn from my very disappointing experience, and stay away!The only upside was that I asked about the Restaurant Week Menu before placing our order. To add insult to injury, Ian just came back to our table and reinforced that he wouldn't honor the Restaurant Week pricing, and gave us a donut instead. We're leaving!We were just at Canela'a Bistro and Wine Bar last night on Saturday, a weekend night, and they honored their Restaurant Week pricing. I think Starbelly did this bait and switch deliberately just to lure people in.  If they realized this was a so-called  ""mistake"" on their part, why not easily rectify it by honoring the $15.00 offer for just two people, that THEY advertised? Unethical  and not at all customer-centric.  Starbelly doesn't deserve your patronage!  I'm sure this lack of customer focus extends  to all aspects of their business practices. There are way too many excellent restaurants all over the Castro for bad treatment! Try Canela's for one, on Market Street.  DO NOT come to Starbelly!!!","stay away!!! deceptive business practice and horrible management!! i'm seated here now at 12:30 pm on sunday (1/27) for

"People are often extra critical of 3.5 Yelp rated restaurants on Yelp. To be honest, I have alot of favorite 3.5 star rated restaurants; I also dislike alot of 4-5 star restaurants and think they're overrated.Bottom line: 3.5 STARS for Starbelly - they have some good eats and are reasonably priced! I would definitely return for a few items and recommend you give it a shot yourself. They have a nice heated outdoor patio which I imagine is perfect for brunch. Reservations are easy online, and it's good for big groups. I have walked by on weekend mornings and noticed there was no line either.As for the food, there were highlights and low lights at Starbelly, and overall I think that the value and taste it was really good. * TIMBERLINE ($7) - 3.5 STARS:Well, I admit I'm a cocktail snob. This one was pretty, and tasted nice with a strong rosemary note, but wasn't as tasty as a few of my other favorite restaurant cocktail bars. Namely: Beretta, Locanda, Range. In the Castro however, I haven't found a good restaurant cocktail bar yet. What a steal though - only $7 - unheard of prices!* PATE ($12) - 4 STARS:house made chicken liver pâté, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustardThis pate is done right. It's a little harder and more crumbly than some but served as a thick slice and with a few pieces of toasted sliced bread.* MUSSELS ($12) - 3 STARS:pan roasted black mussels, Mexican chorizo, market chili & cilantroThis is a small bowl of very tiny mussels. The broth was uninspiring.* BURRATA ($9) - 4 STARS:burrata di stefano, blistered cherry tomato & basil pureeI love burrata and this was no exception. * Side of: CAULIFLOWER ($6) - 3 STARS:marinated mixed cauliflower, chili flakes, shaved red onion & chivesTasted very vinegary, but fresh, simple, and homemade. A somewhat small portion and not unique so I would not order again.* BAVETTE STEAK ($25) - 3.5 STARS:Very nicely cooked (requested medium rare, but the chef recommends medium), tender and flavorful. The sauce/marinade was not my cup of tea.* CRAB GARLIC NOODLES ($21) - 4 STARS:local Dungeness crab, garlic noodle & garlic breadReally decadent and rich crab sauce with a fresh made doughy noodle. Really delicious and filling.* SEA SALT POT DE CREME ($8) - 4 STARS:A decent portion of creamy luscious sea salt pot de creme, served with 2 rosemary shortbread cookies. I was not a huge fan of the cookies, they were thin and crumbly and didn't have enough butter, but I really enjoyed the pot de creme. It was smooth and not especially thick, yet still very creamy.","people are often extra critical of 3.5 yelp rated restaurants on yelp. to be honest, i have alot of favorite 3.5 star rated

"I really like this brunch spot, it's absolutely pretty, the nature asthenic is really cute. When I walked in I really liked there set up, spacious (in terms of crowded SF) I ordered the French toast, which was good. I liked they included pistachio to bring more flavor. The rest of the order was:Veggie burger - good, just the patty was a little dry, which make sense since it's not meat. Italian eggs - the sauce was really goodMushroom pizza - white sauce which I liked a lot. French express coffee - it was strong and flavorful, not bitter can drink without sugar. I would recommend it, if you a coffee person.  The prices seem pricy, but it's normal for SF. The portions are large, which makes sense.","i really like this brunch spot, it's absolutely pretty, the nature asthenic is really cute. when i walked in i really liked there set up, spacious (in terms of crowded sf) i ordered the french toast, which was good. i liked they included pistachio to bring more flavor. the rest of the order was:veggie burger - good, just the patty was a little dry, which make sense since it's not meat. italian eggs - the sauce was really goodmushroom pizza - white sauce which i liked a lot. french express coffee - it was strong and flavorful, not bitter can drink without sugar. i would recommend it, if you a coffee person. the prices seem pricy, but it's normal for sf. the portions are large, which makes sense.",i really like this brunch spot its absolutely pretty the nature asthenic is really cute when i walked in i really liked there set up spacious in terms of crowded sf i ordered the french toast which was good i liked they included pistachio to bring more flavor the rest of the order wasveggie burger  good just the patty was a little dry which make sense since its not meat italian eggs  the sauce was really goodmushroom pizza  white sauce which i liked a lot french express coffee  it was strong and flavorful not bitter can drink without sugar i would recommend it if you a coffee person the prices seem pricy but its normal for sf the portions are large which makes sense,really like brunch spot absolutely pretty nature asthenic really cute walked really liked set spacious terms crowded sf ordered french toast good liked included pistachio bring flavor rest order wasveggie burger good patty little dry make sense since meat italian eggs sauce really goodmushroom pizza white sauce liked lot french express coffee strong flavorful bitter drink without sugar would recommend coffee person prices seem pricy normal sf portions large makes sense,really like brunch spot absolutely pretty nature asthenic really cute walked really liked set spacious terms crowded sf ordered french toast good liked included pistachio bring flavor rest order wasveggie burger good patty little dry make sense since meat italian eggs sauce really goodmushroom pizza white sauce liked lot french express coffee strong flavorful bitter drink without sugar recommend coffee person prices seem pricy normal sf portions large makes sense,really like brunch spot absolutely pretty nature asthenic really cute walked really liked set spacious term crowded sf ordered french toast good liked included pistachio bring flavor rest order wasveggie burger good patty little dry make sense since meat italian egg sauce really goodmushroom pizza white sauce liked lot french express coffee strong flavorful bitter drink without sugar recommend coffee person price seem pricy normal sf portion large make sense,0.2522869674185464,0.49536340852130323

"Came back for lunch. The little gem lettuce Caesar was nice. It comes with avocado, but the lettuce is served in big chunks--any cooking show with world class chefs state that caesar should be torn bite-sized. It was still good though. The housemade pate is delicious but the bread they serve with it is too sweet. A traditional baguette would be so much better, even crackers would be better. They serve it with jam which is okay but cornichons would be so much better.","came back for lunch. the little gem lettuce caesar was nice. it comes with avocado, but the lettuce is served in big chunks--any cooking show with world class chefs state that caesar should be torn bite-sized. it was still good though. the housemade pate is delicious but the bread they serve with it is too sweet. a traditional baguette would be so much better, even crackers would be better. they serve it with jam which is okay but cornichons would be so much better.",came back for lunch the little gem lettuce caesar was nice it comes with avocado but the lettuce is served in big chunksany cooking show with world class chefs state that caesar should be torn bitesized it was still good though the housemade pate is delicious but the bread they serve with it is too sweet a traditional baguette would be so much better even crackers would be better they serve it with jam which is okay but cornichons would be so much better,came back lunch little gem lettuce caesar nice comes avocado lettuce served big chunksany cooking show world class chefs state caesar torn bitesized still good though housemade pate delicious bread serve sweet traditional baguette would much better even crackers would better serve jam okay cornichons would much better,back lunch little gem lettuce caesar nice comes avocado lettuce served big chunksany cooking show world class chefs state caesar torn bitesized still good though housemade pate delicious bread serve sweet traditional baguette much better even crackers better serve jam okay cornichons much better,back lunch little gem lettuce caesar nice come avocado lettuce served big chunksany cooking show world class chef state caesar torn bitesized still good though housemade pate delicious bread serve sweet traditional baguette much better even cracker better serve jam okay cornichons much better,0.371875,0.5499999999999999

"Ambitious to start off San Francisco Restaurant Week, a coworker and I decided to go to Starbelly for our first of many food adventures for the next ten days. We chose Starbelly for it's affordable menu options and value. The menu seemed not to have changed much since last year. AMBIANCE was hipsterly cute as we were seated in the heated patio decorated with a striped tent overhead, hanging lights and plants adorning the walls. FOOD was medicore by San Francisco standards. The kitchen went light on the spices and salt on all the dishes. The coleslaw on the fried chicken sandwich could have used a kick, and the chicken could have been brined or the crust seasoned. I'm not a fan of pate but it was the best dish of the meal. The bread was great quality and the mustard and fruit spread went well with the pate.","ambitious to start off san francisco restaurant week, a coworker and i decided to go to starbelly for our first of many food adventures for the next ten days. we chose starbelly for it's affordable menu options and value. the menu seemed not to have changed much since last year. ambiance was hipsterly cute as we were seated in the heated patio decorated with a striped tent overhead, hanging lights and plants adorning the walls. food was medicore by san francisco standards. the kitchen went light on the spices and salt on all the dishes. the coleslaw on the fried chicken sandwich could have used a kick, and the chicken could have been brined or the crust seasoned. i'm not a fan of pate but it was the best dish of the meal. the bread was great quality and the mustard and fruit spread went well with the pate.",ambitious to start off san francisco restaurant week a coworker and i decided to go to starbelly for our first of many food adventures for the next ten days we chose starbelly for its affordable menu options and value the menu seemed not to have changed much since last year ambiance was hipsterly cute as we were seated in the heated patio decorated with a striped tent overhead hanging lights and plants adorning the walls food was medicore by san francisco standards the kitchen went light on the spices and salt on all the dishes the coleslaw on the fried chicken sandwich could have used a kick and the chicken could have been brined or the crust seasoned im not a fan of pate but it was the best dish of the meal the bread was great quality and the mustard and fruit spread went well with the pate,ambitious start san francisco restaurant week coworker decided go starbelly first many food adventures next ten days chose starbelly affordable menu options value menu seemed changed much since last year ambiance hipsterly cute seated heated patio decorated striped tent overhead hanging lights plants adorning walls food medicore san francisco standards kitchen went light spices salt dishes coleslaw fried chicken sandwich could used kick chicken could brined crust seasoned im fan pate best dish meal bread great quality mustard fruit spread went well pate,ambitious start san francisco restaurant week coworker decided starbelly first many food adventures next ten days chose starbelly affordable menu options value menu seemed changed much since last year ambiance hipsterly cute seated heated patio decorated striped tent overhead hanging lights plants adorning walls food medicore san francisco standards kitchen went light spices salt dishes coleslaw fried chicken sandwich could used kick chicken could brined crust seasoned fan pate best dish meal bread great quality mustard fruit spread went well pate,ambitious start san francisco restaurant week coworker decided starbelly first many food adventure next ten day chose starbelly affordable menu option value menu seemed changed much since last year ambiance hipsterly cute seated heated patio decorated striped tent overhead hanging light plant adorning wall food medicore san francisco standard kitchen went light spice salt dish coleslaw fried chicken sandwich could used kick chicken could brined crust seasoned fan pate best dish meal bread great quality mustard fruit spread went well pate,0.20937499999999998,0.465625

"We arrived and we're promptly greeted by the hostess who sat us almost immediately. The server (girl with red hair) greeted us and  told us she would give us time and came back shortly there after with water. She took our drink and food order at the same time. Little did I know this would be the last time we would see her until we were finished with our meal. Someone else brought our drinks and our food. Never once were we checked on, at any point. No one came to offer more water (we got up and refilled it ourselves). No one checked on us after we got our food. We finished and sat there for a solid 10 mins with completely finished plates in front of us. I know our server saw us because I watched her walk by several times and check on the table next to us. When she came to clear our plates she finally offered us another round of drinks. Well, no... We are done. I would have ordered another one 20 mins ago had you ever come to check on us. I personally wouldn't recommend this place until they get their service standards under control.

"My roommate made reservations for 3 and then day of our other roommate decided to join so we contacted them right away. Starbelly was very accommodating especially for a Friday night. We arrived on time and were seated right away at one of their high top communal tables (two people on each side). I understand why these types of tables are popular (easy to seat random size groups quickly and they don't encourage people to stay too long since they are loud and not super comfortable). But we had a reservation and the restaurant has plenty of regular tables. The communal table is right next to the open kitchen area and right in the middle of the restaurant. It's incredibly loud, like to the point where we stopped trying to talk among the four of us and instead just talked to the person sitting next to us. The server had to ask the part of our group that was sitting opposite her to speak louder because she couldn't hear their order. She could have gone all the way around the table to get their order but that would have been super awkward. If the server couldn't get their order imagine how the conversation was with the four of us trying to yell to hear each other. We ordered a few drinks and I split a pizza with one of my roommates. The drinks, food and service would get 4 stars but the atmosphere here was completely undesirable to me. I would be open to giving this place another shot but with so many restaurants in the area with much better atmospheres I think it might be a while.","my roommate made reservations for 3 and then day

The setup of the place is great. I always sit in their back patio area. Apparently they've recently received noise complaints from the neighboring apartments so they have to close the patio by 9pm. Food is OK. Pizzas are not the best i've had.

"I came here for brunch, and it was quite busy so I'm glad I made a reservation. Starbelly is close to public transit so for someone without a car, it was easy for me to get to.The brunch menu isn't very extensive but has a good variety. I was debating between the chilaquiles and the chorizo pizza and decided to go for the chilaquiles since I didn't want to eat pizza for brunch.The chilaquiles was huge and really good! I liked that it comes with salad so that it doesn't feel like a completely unhealthy meal. I do wish that there was less chips or everything wasn't mixed in already because at the end of my meal, I was trying to pick off all the toppings since I couldn't finish the chips. But this is definitely one of the better chilaquiles I've had before so I'd recommend it!","i came here for brunch, and it was quite busy so i'm glad i made a reservation. starbelly is close to public transit so for someone without a car, it was easy for me to get to.the brunch menu isn't very extensive but has a good variety. i was debating between the chilaquiles and the chorizo pizza and decided to go for the chilaquiles since i didn't want to eat pizza for brunch.the chilaquiles was huge and really good! i liked that it comes with salad so that it doesn't feel like a completely unhealthy meal. i do wish that there was less chips or everything wasn't mixed in already because at the end of my meal, i was trying to pick off all the toppings since i couldn't finish the chips. but this is definitely one of the better chilaquiles i've had before so i'd recommend it!",i came here for brunch and it was quite busy so im glad i made a reservation starbelly is close to public transit so for someone without a car it was easy for me to get tothe brunch menu isnt very extensive but has a good variety i was debating between the chilaquiles and the chorizo pizza and decided to go for the chilaquiles since i didnt want to eat pizza for brunchthe chilaquiles was huge and really good i liked that it comes with salad so that it doesnt feel like a completely unhealthy meal i do wish that there was less chips or everything wasnt mixed in already because at the end of my meal i was trying to pick off all the toppings since i couldnt finish the chips but this is definitely one of the better chilaquiles ive had before so id recommend it,came brunch quite busy im glad made reservation starbelly close public transit someone without car easy get tothe brunch menu isnt extensive good variety debating chilaquiles chorizo pizza decided go chilaquiles since didnt want eat pizza brunchthe chilaquiles huge really good liked comes salad doesnt feel like completely unhealthy meal wish less chips everything wasnt mixed already end meal trying pick toppings since couldnt finish chips definitely one better chilaquiles ive id recommend,brunch quite busy glad made reservation starbelly close public transit someone without car easy tothe brunch menu isnt extensive good variety debating chilaquiles chorizo pizza decided chilaquiles since didnt want eat pizza brunchthe chilaquiles huge really good liked comes salad doesnt feel like completely unhealthy meal wish less chips everything wasnt mixed already end meal trying pick toppings since couldnt finish chips definitely better chilaquiles ive id recommend,brunch quite busy glad made reservation starbelly close public transit someone without car easy tothe brunch menu isnt extensive good variety debating chilaquiles chorizo pizza decided chilaquiles since didnt want eat pizza brunchthe chilaquiles huge really good liked come salad doesnt feel like completely unhealthy meal wish le chip everything wasnt mixed already end meal trying pick topping since couldnt finish chip definitely better chilaquiles ive id recommend,0.29444444444444445,0.5736111111111112

"I used to go to Starbelly often before COVID And liked their menu . However, I went there tonite and was disappointed to see how mediocre their food has become.

"Came here for a lunch in their beautiful back patio. We were seated promptly with our reservation and our orders were taken quickly. We got our drinks but our food took a little while. We didn't complain or make any comment, it was a beautiful day and we weren't in a rush. Perhaps it's because I'm now visibly pregnant (or just good self-awareness by the staff) the manager came by to apologize for the delay with our food and offered to bring us some complimentary drinks. Our server also apologized for the wait. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal when it arrived, the starbelly bacon pizza is soooooooo good! When our bill came, the server had also taken care of our entrees, a kind gesture. We would have been happy to pay for our delicious food, but this attention to detail and care toward their customers will put Starbelly even higher on our lunch rotation. Thanks for a lovely, relaxing meal!","came here for a lunch in their beautiful back patio. we were seated promptly with our reservation and our orders were taken quickly. we got our drinks but our food took a little while. we didn't complain or make any comment, it was a beautiful day and we weren't in a rush. perhaps it's because i'm now visibly pregnant (or just good self-awareness by the staff) the manager came by to apologize for the delay with our food and offered to bring us some complimentary drinks. our server also apologized for the wait. we thoroughly enjoyed our meal when it arrived, the starbelly bacon pizza is soooooooo good! when our bill came, the server had also taken care of our entrees, a kind gesture. we would have been happy to pay for our delicious food, but this attention to detail and care toward their customers will put starbelly even higher on our lunch rotation. thanks for a lovely, relaxing meal!",came here for a lunch in their beautiful back patio we were seated promptly with our reservation and our orders were taken quickly we got our drinks but our food took a little while we didnt complain or make any comment it was a beautiful day and we werent in a rush perhaps its because im now visibly pregnant or just good selfawareness by the staff the manager came by to apologize for the delay with our food and offered to bring us some complimentary drinks our server also apologized for the wait we thoroughly enjoyed our meal when it arrived the starbelly bacon pizza is soooooooo good when our bill came the server had also taken care of our entrees a kind gesture we would have been happy to pay for our delicious food but this attention to detail and care toward their customers will put starbelly even higher on our lunch rotation thanks for a lovely relaxing meal,came lunch beautiful back patio seated promptly reservation orders taken quickly got drinks food took little didnt complain make comment beautiful day werent rush perhaps im visibly pregnant good selfawareness staff manager came apologize delay food offered bring us complimentary drinks server also apologized wait thoroughly enjoyed meal arrived starbelly bacon pizza soooooooo good bill came server also taken care entrees kind gesture would happy pay delicious food attention detail care toward customers put starbelly even higher lunch rotation thanks lovely relaxing meal,lunch beautiful back patio seated promptly reservation orders taken quickly drinks food took little didnt complain make comment beautiful day werent rush perhaps visibly pregnant good selfawareness staff manager apologize delay food offered bring complimentary drinks server also apologized wait thoroughly enjoyed meal arrived starbelly bacon pizza soooooooo good bill server also taken care entrees kind gesture happy pay delicious food attention detail care toward customers put starbelly even higher lunch rotation thanks lovely relaxing meal,lunch beautiful back patio seated promptly reservation order taken quickly drink food took little didnt complain make comment beautiful day werent rush perhaps visibly pregnant good selfawareness staff manager apologize delay food offered bring complimentary drink server also apologized wait thoroughly enjoyed meal arrived starbelly bacon pizza soooooooo good bill server also taken care entree kind gesture happy pay delicious food attention detail care toward customer put starbelly even higher lunch rotation thanks lovely relaxing meal,0.48307291666666663,0.640625
"Don't even know where to start.  I was excited to come back after loving the place pre Covid.  Hosted a party of 9.  Restaurant wasn't too busy.  The waiter was obviously stoned out of his mind.  Couldn't remember anything.  Apps arrived. Fries were so undercooked and greasy we sent them back, twice.  Other apps of pate was good, but small amount of bread, asked for more, three times.  Nada.  Waiter skipped three of the people when placing the order for mains.  When we walked up to ensure he had the remaining orders he was spaced out.  Meals arrived for half the table.  It took 20 minutes for the other half of guests.   The pizza that was suppose to be well done was doughy. Overall it is a mere showdown of its former self. Food was not great.  We ordered wine, they brought the wrong ones, twice. I don't know if it was the stoned waiter, the cooks or just entire staffs just inability to care about anything.  What bothers me is that it used to be my favorite spot.  I guess I need to move on.","don't even know where to start. i was excited to come back after loving the place pre covid. hosted a party of 9. restaurant wasn't too busy. the waiter was obviously stoned out of his mind. couldn't remember anything. apps arrived. fries were so undercooked and greasy we sent them back, twice. other apps of pate was good, but small amount of bread, asked for more, three times. nada. waiter skipped three of the people when placing the order for mains. when we walked up to ensure he had the remaining orders he was spaced out. meals arrived for half the table. it took 20 minutes for the other half of guests. the pizza that was suppose to be well done was doughy. overall it is a mere showdown of its former self. food was not great. we ordered wine, they brought the wrong ones, twice. i don't know if it was the stoned waiter, the cooks or just entire staffs just inability to care about anything. what bothers me is that it used to be my favorite spot. i guess i need to move on.",dont even know where to start i was excited to come back after loving the place pre covid hosted a party of 9 restaurant wasnt too busy the waiter was obviously stoned out of his mind couldnt remember anything apps arrived fries were so undercooked and greasy we sent them back twice other apps of pate was good but small amount of bread asked for more three times nada waiter skipped three of the people when placing the order for mains when we walked up to ensure he had the remaining orders he was spaced out meals arrived for half the table it took 20 minutes for the other half of guests the pizza that was suppose to be well done was doughy overall it is a mere showdown of its former self food was not great we ordered wine they brought the wrong ones twice i dont know if it was the stoned waiter the cooks or just entire staffs just inability to care about anything what bothers me is that it used to be my favorite spot i guess i need to move on,dont even know start excited come back loving place pre covid hosted party 9 restaurant wasnt busy waiter obviously stoned mind couldnt remember anything apps arrived fries undercooked greasy sent back twice apps pate good small amount bread asked three times nada waiter skipped three people placing order mains walked ensure remaining orders spaced meals arrived half table took 20 minutes half guests pizza suppose well done doughy overall mere showdown former self food great ordered wine brought wrong ones twice dont know stoned waiter cooks entire staffs inability care anything bothers used favorite spot guess need move,dont even know start excited come back loving place pre covid hosted party 9 restaurant wasnt busy waiter obviously stoned mind couldnt remember anything apps arrived fries undercooked greasy sent back twice apps pate good small amount bread asked three times nada waiter skipped three people placing order mains walked ensure remaining orders spaced meals arrived half table took 20 minutes half guests pizza suppose well done doughy overall mere showdown former self food great ordered wine brought wrong ones twice dont know stoned waiter cooks entire staffs inability care anything bothers used favorite spot guess need move,dont even know start excited come back loving place pre covid hosted party 9 restaurant wasnt busy waiter obviously stoned mind couldnt remember anything apps arrived fry undercooked greasy sent back twice apps pate good small amount bread asked three time nada waiter skipped three people placing order main walked ensure remaining order spaced meal arrived half table took 20 minute half guest pizza suppose well done doughy overall mere showdown former self food great ordered wine brought wrong one twice dont know stoned waiter cook entire staff inability care anything bother used favorite spot guess need move,0.09212962962962962,0.44120370370370376
"Intimate vibes, great music, and fantastic service. Seriously. I forgot what our server's name was, but he was one of the best servers I've had in a LONG time. He gave us the right amount of attention and made us feel extremely welcomed and comfortable at the restaurant. So comfortable that he was able to convince a few people in the group to eat stuff that they typically wouldn't. Heck... we gave him the liberty to order whatever he thought was best and surprise us LOL I don't remember everytthinnng we had, but I do remember really enjoying the mussels and pate. Everything was good, to be completely honest. There wasn't a single dish out of the possibly 10 we had that we didnt like. Their cocktails were also really good! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try :)","intimate vibes, great music, and fantastic service. seriously. i forgot what our server's name was, but he was one of the best servers i've had in a long time. he gave us the right amount of attention and made us feel extremely welcomed and comfortable at the restaurant. so comfortable that he was able to convince a few people in the group to eat stuff that they typically wouldn't. heck... we gave him the liberty to order whatever he thought was best and surprise us lol i don't remember everytthinnng we had, but i do remember really enjoying the mussels and pate. everything was good, to be completely honest. there wasn't a single dish out of the possibly 10 we had that we didnt like. their cocktails were also really good! i would definitely recommend giving this place a try :)",intimate vibes great music and fantastic service seriously i forgot what our servers name was but he was one of the best servers ive had in a long time he gave us the right amount of attention and made us feel extremely welcomed and comfortable at the restaurant so comfortable that he was able to convince a few people in the group to eat stuff that they typically wouldnt heck we gave him the liberty to order whatever he thought was best and surprise us lol i dont remember everytthinnng we had but i do remember really enjoying the mussels and pate everything was good to be completely honest there wasnt a single dish out of the possibly 10 we had that we didnt like their cocktails were also really good i would definitely recommend giving this place a try ,intimate vibes great music fantastic service seriously forgot servers name one best servers ive long time gave us right amount attention made us feel extremely welcomed comfortable restaurant comfortable able convince people group eat stuff typically wouldnt heck gave liberty order whatever thought best surprise us lol dont remember everytthinnng remember really enjoying mussels pate everything good completely honest wasnt single dish possibly 10 didnt like cocktails also really good would definitely recommend giving place try,intimate vibes great music fantastic service seriously forgot servers name best servers ive long time gave right amount attention made feel extremely welcomed comfortable restaurant comfortable able convince people group eat stuff typically wouldnt heck gave liberty order whatever thought best surprise lol dont remember everytthinnng remember really enjoying mussels pate everything good completely honest wasnt single dish possibly 10 didnt like cocktails also really good definitely recommend giving place,intimate vibe great music fantastic service seriously forgot server name best server ive long time gave right amount attention made feel extremely welcomed comfortable restaurant comfortable able convince people group eat stuff typically wouldnt heck gave liberty order whatever thought best surprise lol dont remember everytthinnng remember really enjoying mussel pate everything good completely honest wasnt single dish possibly 10 didnt like cocktail also really good definitely recommend giving place,0.35901360544217686,0.6329365079365078
"Starbelly: Left these Bellies EmptyHave eaten here before and it was a good experience: great food, pretty attentive wait staff, and good vibes all around. However came back here just today with a reservation, and when we showed up on time, we're initially ignored and not even welcomed in. Then one of the hostesses asks for time of the reservation and the name it's under, and once we tell her, she looks a bit flustered and tells us that our table is being prepared. We go and wait outside for 15 minutes, and a whole other new host (the one who didn't even welcome us in when we first got there) comes up and asks us if we even have a reservation. We again tell him the time and name and he also tells us, okay your table just needs to get bussed. Mind you, while we have been waiting outside, another party of 3 (same as my party) shows up later than we do, and then they proceed to be seated before us.
