"Starbelly is always a solid stop for a meal in the Castro. I came here for dinner during Pride weekend and it was busy but still not a long wait to get a table. The cocktails were strong, the food was flavorful and fresh. We got the thai spiced pork sausage (tasty bites), the white bean puré (creamy!), and the spahgetti (solid) along with the steak skewer (a great bite) Will definitely be coming back on my next visit.",79,421,30
"Stopped by for a late brunch in the Castro and overall enjoyed the experience.The weekend brunch menu is creative with enough variety. I recommend the French toast and their spring gazpacho was refreshing. The house (Starbelly) salad was average, but I think people come here for the multiple cocktail options for happy hour.I appreciate their heated outdoor seating, and indoor space is also quite welcoming. Service was nice and attentive.",70,441,24
"Cutest place, sat outside in the back and the heaters are abundant, so you will not get cold. Ordered micheladas and a couple other cocktails and all were great. The food is on point, every single thing was so yummy. We ordered the Starbelly bacon pizza, the green goddess sauce on it is a game changer, so good. The other item you must order is the chicken and French toast, everyone at the table tried it and loved it. The service was fantastic!",83,447,36
My family and I had a great time last Friday night for dinner. Food are reasonably price with a good portion and wonderful flavor. Staff are nice. Service is fast. The ambiance is upbeat. I like the back patio where we were seated. Definitely will come back.,47,258,16
"Starbelly is one of those places that feels like home away from home. It is on the intersection in the Castro neighborhood and there is street parking available on the weekdays. Finding parking was easy and we were able to walk around to see some shops.Arriving at happy hour, there is a display with a huge array of drinks behind the counter. We were greeted by the happy manager Adam and we encountered a couple who told us that Starbelly's pizza is something to die for. Starbelly provided some cool tones inside. My friend and I sat in the patio that has a covering on the top with star decorations on the walls. It was nice that the heater was on. Some nights in San Francisco can get pretty chilly.The server Chris (I hope I spelled their name correctly) was very kind and inviting. She was very patient when we asked about specific ingredients from the menu.My friend went for the burger and fries during happy hour and I ate margarita pizza. The couple was right. The pizza was fantastic and it wasn't salty compared to some places I have visited in San Francisco. The French fries were crunchy and I love it.I think what makes this place so attractive is that people like Adam and Chris make sure that your experience is memorable. In tough days or just an exploration, they invite you to return to their humble and charming restaurant. I just wished I took a picture of the food but we got so hungry that the food has been demolished in less than a minute.Thank you for having us here, Adam! We will come back again. :)",280,1529,121
"I'm here for the beautiful cocktails, easy atmosphere, minimal lines for weekday brunch, the amazing blonde waitress that made our day and simple California-style menu :-)Perfect place for catch up time with your friends, beautiful outdoor covered area / sunroom. Just gives you a happy feel good vibe and their menu served perfect portions for a table for 2",59,358,19
Food is great and simple! No frills- we got CHF i Ken and waffles and the salad with grilled chicken. Portion for the salad was quite small. But fresh. Prices are great. The one downside is the service is super slow probably because only one person was working the whole back patio felt bad for him. Our drinks never arrived.,60,325,20
"Starbelly is a neighborhood gem that needs to be a part of everyone's regular rotation. It's a great option for a weeknight burger and fries, but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving. The bacon pizza is so scrumptious. The crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over. The arugula adds a nice peppery touch. This specific night I decided to try the Toffee Cake, and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream, which was the Chocolate Caramel Crackle--the two together was AMAZING. I'm going back just for that dessert combo.",103,573,41
"One of my favorite places in San Francisco to have delicious & beautiful food with wonderful cocktails. My go to is the house made pate - decadent, white bean dip - beautiful, fries with 3 dips - LOVE (goes so well with a martini) and wonderful Starbelly salad. Although the pizzas are phenomenal there too.The service is on point- upbeat, and very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.Had the newest cocktail -Passionflower: tequila and passion fruit. I tend to order a vodka martini, but this sounded so amazing.! And it was so yummy. I'll add more to my review the next time I go. I just go so often that, silly me, forgot to give them the a great review ;)",121,663,44
"Made reservations for Wednesday brunch at 11:30, upon arriving we were seated promptly. Inside of the restaurant was pretty vacant but the patio in the back was full. Food: Challah French Toast - great sweet brunch option, two large slices of custardy french toast serve with strawberry conserve, mascarpone and pistachios, not too sweet and surprisingly light definitely worth ordering if you're looking for something sweetButternut squash pizza - a really interesting combo of flavors, base was a pesto along with black garlic, ricotta salata, pepitas and butternut squash, crust was good, crisp and chewy, a bit on the greasy end but over pretty tasty Bibb lettuce salad - tasty, salad was probably dressed, and well seasoned, bacon was crisp, chicken was well grilled, overall a very good classic saladFries - thin and fried crisp, my preferred style, can't go wrong,  thoroughly enjoyed the trio of sauces that came with them Service was good, no complaints, were offered water and coffee refills when needed. Overall one of my favorite spots in the city for an affordable brunch or dinner. Food is always dependably good, drinks are reasonably priced and the menu maintains a good balance of classic dishes along with interesting seasonal offerings.",203,1255,66
"Good place if you want a cheap restaurant (we spend 60$ in 3) or an easy reservation. Speaking of the food, they have basic dishes. The quality is ok, not something very outstanding but you can easily enjoy. The ambiance is nice and the service is pretty fast and efficient.",50,274,21
"Went around 11:30 am on Sunday and ordered the chicken and waffles here for the second time and they're still as good as I remembered them to be. The portion size, presentation, chicken to waffle to ratio is perfect for me. The chilaquiles was also delicious but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. It's such a cute place. Service was a bit slow, but it was also pride day.",71,375,30
"Great food, drinks and service at an affordable price. Great ambiance as well. Highly recommended",15,97,4
"Came here for happy hour after a hike and thoroughly enjoyed the $20 burger deal ($20 for a burger, fries and a cocktail). We each ended up getting that deal and were so happy and full afterwards and continued with a few roses. Will gladly come here again for the happy hour and great service.",55,293,26
"In the heart of the Castro, there's outdoor seating, bar seating & a hidden patio in the back. Well-designed interior & you can see the chefs prepare your food as well! I went on a tuesday lunch &  I thought it was empty until I saw a full patioMy friends and I went for the restaurant week deal and we got:- chicken liver pate: one of their best appetizers by far, the whole grain mustard, marmalade & the cut of bread gave a carnival of flavors in my mouth! It made me eager to try the rest of the deal- fries & 3 dips : The fries were nothing special. The basil aioli was light and refreshing but could have used a bit of parmesan or salt. The old bay aioli could have used a lot more seasoning as well. The last dip was ketchup- fried chicken po'boy: really more of a fried chicken sandwich, surprised it came on a brioche. Buns were toasted though and it was a great bread to soak up the flavor but that leads me to the next part: it had no flavor.  The texture & cook were perfect but the juicy chicken had no seasoning, and the slaw was lacking (could have used more). I was putting the trio dips on my sandwich to compensate but it was not enough. I get that this place is more focused on healthy clean food but there are ways to incorporate more flavors!This is an amazing place to dine at but it failed to deliver on flavor. I am willing to come back another day to try the rest of the menu but I left feeling very dissapointed",281,1437,116
"Had a reservation for 2 on a Sunday night at 5:30, plenty of space, so I was seated immediately. The space has a really nice dimmed lighting, creating a great intimate space for small groups. Ordered the broccoli rapini, flavor was great but a bit salty and extremely oily. Asked for half vegan cheese on the pizza and they accommodated! It was really good, crispy and thin crust just how I like it! Managed to finish all of it with 2 people. Although I just realized that the arugula we ordered did not get added on top of the pizza and I forgot to mention it since we were so hungry! Regardless it was a pleasant experience and appreciated them for catering to my sensitive stomach!",126,684,54
"Came here for a casual 3 person brunch on a Thursday and loved everything we ordered! We were seated outdoors immediately and loved the ambiance of the front outdoor area + the heaters overhead. The portions were huge, especially the fried chicken and French toast, which I only finished half of and took the rest home to eat later. The french toast was so spongey and not too sweet, which paired perfectly with the crispness of the chicken. I got the lychee cocktail which was very sweet and delicious! Id recommend getting the fries because they had three great dipping sauces.",101,579,41
"Cool space, but I was a little disappointed in the food. Is was fine but nothing amazing. Not worth the price in my opinion. Service was good but they forgot to bring us a drink that they ultimately charged us for.",41,214,17
"Came for dinner with a group of friends and we shared a few dishes! We started with fried, pate and cauliflower. It was all sooo delicious and loved how unique the food was.For mains, we shared two pizzas that were both amazing! It was just enough food for the 5 of us where we were satisfied but think we could have eaten one more large dish like a pizza to be properly full",73,375,34
"Dinner before a movie brought us to Starbelly for an early dinner. We were seated inside at a high-table. Started with the chicken liver pate. It was good but somehow it lacked flavor!! I am a Pate lover and it just didn't leave the greatest impression. My salad was good, and my husband enjoyed his burger. The burger and salad were both in the small side!!  Entrees tasted good but nothing was a standout.",74,407,32
Came here after doing Barry's Bootcamp so this was super conveniently close and lots of reservations were available. Good:- Loved the cauliflower soup - so much flavor packed into each bowl- Fan of the Star bacon pizza - I liked the tomato sauce and bacon combo and it was good even though I'm not usually a fan of arugula - I liked the loco moco - definitely on the smaller side but the medium rare loco moco was tasty and left me wanting more - The freshly squeezed orange juice was heavenly - started drinking it and couldn't stop! - Upscale modern ambiance Bad: - The butternut squash didn't work as well for me - I didn't like the combo of flavors very much and the cheese didn't really sit right for me either Overall very high quality place and great for dates - we came for a double date and would come back - reasonable prices too.,158,840,56
"3.5 STARS- the storefront makes the restaurant seem deceptively small, but once inside you can see just how much seating there is, as well as in the backyard patio- the interior is really cute and the ambiance is nice, lots of conversation and noise- we went on a tuesday for lunch and though the outdoor and indoor seating were empty, the patio was pretty full- my friends and i went for the restaurant week deal and we got:- chicken liver pate (5/5): this was the best dish we got! the pate was creamy and flavorful, the bread was thick cut, perfectly grilled, and crusty, and the whole grain mustard and caramelized onion jam combined with everything to make the perfect bite. unfortunately this also raised our expectations for the other dishes a little too high- fries+trio of dips (2/5): the fries were nothing special, my friend said if you told him they were in-n-out fries he wouldn't have questioned it. the basil aioli was light and refreshing, but lacked flavor. the old bay aioli didn't taste like anything. the only solid dip was the ketchup :/- fried chicken po'boy (3/5): really more of a fried chicken sandwich, as it didn't come on french bread but regular buns. the buns were toasted well and super light and fluffy though! the chicken was fried really well and moist BUT it didn't taste like anything. i dont think the breading was seasoned, there wasn't enough sauce, and the cabbage/jalapenos didn't add any flavor or moistness, so it ended up being kind of dry and tasteless overall. i ended up adding the dips to the sandwich to try to add some moisture and flavor. also, we saw that the sandwiches that were brought out to others sitting near us looked fuller than ours which was somewhat disappointing. - overall this place is super cute and had a lot of potential, but sadly did not deliver on flavor for the majority of their dishes. i might come back to try their other dishes though just because the ambiance and pate were really good.",348,1965,158
"Cute restaurant in the Castro, close to the intersection of Noe Valley. They serve standard American fare - think burgers on thick buns and trendy appetizers like white bean dip and salads with goat cheese. There's a lovely covered outdoor patio which usually fills up quickly for brunch and dinner. They have a happy hour that ends at 6 PM, I highly recommend getting there at 5 PM and having cocktails and appetizers. Weeknights and weekend mornings fill up pretty quickly. Service is a bit slow, but staff is extremely friendly and it's easy to flag someone down. The food is good all 'round -- for dinner, we have tried everything from the halibut to the pasta to the burgers. The rice pudding with cherries for dessert is a nice happy ending :D",133,749,47
The service was absolutely amazing and the food was even better! Loved the crafted cocktails too! This absolutely was a great vibe and can't wait to come back again!,29,165,9
"This place was truly amazing but went downhill in the past year. The prices are very high and the food, while good doesn't justify the cost per portion if you consider the size. The pizza was also mediocre last time we had it and contained a random date pit. We used to come here every few weeks and we are not going to come back in the near future.",69,349,30
Easy to get a table for Sunday brunch. There is parklet seating and a huge backyard seating for outdoors then inside tables and a bar as well.Chilaquiles were a good portion and tasty. Would have been better with more spice or a salsa. Side salad was mildly dressed and nice to have greens with the meal.Lychee cocktail was pleasant but I wish there was more flavor to it. Lychee itself was light and overpowered by the lemon. Definitely a lot of create cocktails I look forward to trying in the future,91,502,42
"We came here for my coworkers bday, and it was great vibes all around.We ordered a lot, and we spent $89/person for about 13 people. We ordered hella appetizers, including fries and more but I ordered the burger, which was very solid with the melted cheese.Would def come back and try ordering less because I was just too stuffed",59,329,26
"Good food and good service. My friends and I had the following food: - Starbelly salad - delicious and refreshing- Fresh spaghetti with bacon - great and tasty. Pasta was perfectly al dente.- Crab rangoon squid ink pasta - delicious and VERY flavorful, with lots of crab meat! - Salty pup grapefruit drink (with gin, elderflower, fresh grapefruit) - refreshing and sweet- Cucumber basil limeade drink - too sour/bitter- Warm beets & goat cheese - good, soft, and warm- Crispy fried brussels sprouts - good - Puree of carrot and celery root soup - thick, creamy, and tasty. Curry spiced pears added a unique twist to the soup flavor",109,631,20
"Seriously great food here. Servers were delightful even with such an insane brunch rush. It's a shame I didn't get my servers name he was so lovely and kind with us!!! Otherwise I would shout him out on here. I ordered the corn pizza as corn and cheese a pretty popular asian food combo and I am usually attuned to the taste of my culture  it did have some latin American flavor twist to it with the sauce which was some sort of aioli. I will say it was a tad bit greasy, but hey its a pizza. Italian and oil goes hand in hand. My other friend got the French toast with fantastic toppings with something alike to a blueberry preservative, some nutty seeds and a MASCARPONE. Will say the MASCARPONE I have tried on other french toasts before were a bit more whipped, light and fluffy. This one was a bit more thick and more of a regular cream cheese consistency. Not mad though, it balanced the flavors very well but my friend wasnt a huge fan. My other friend accompanying me ordered the Loco Moco. I also found it peculiar that there seems to be an Asian cuisine twist on this traditionally Latin dish. I tasted a bit of it and it mightve been the best thing on the table. It had a perfectly season sunny side up egg, a hamburger patty cooked about medium rare, over some rice. there was a bit of dehydrated fried onions as well as fresh cut green onions garnishing the egg, and topped off with a soy GLAZE! not soy sauce... a GLAZE! i need the recipe for this supposed glaze cuz it was amazing. I don't even rlly like red meats that much or eat them on the regular, so it was very shocking to me how the flavors were very balanced. Very cute seating, we sat indoors but there is a very nice patio and a bar too.",329,1713,147
"Came for an early Sunday brunch, easily secured a table for 2 around 11am but the place definitely seems to fill up as time goes by.The inside is real nice, spacious and bright. There is a patio where you can sit with your dog, as well as seats in the front. Inside was fine, although it got pretty loud once more people arrived adjacent to our table.The menu isn't as expensive as other brunch spots, but still has some fun stuff on it. Win! I got the Chilaquiles and a coffee, my vegetarian companion got the Italian eggs with a side of fruit. I didn't see any fancier coffee options, so I would double check with them if that's what you're into.The food was solid - good, but not mind blowing. It hit the spot for a casual brunch. What lacked -the chilaquiles, while tasty, felt a bit one note and could have used some more heat or zest. House made chorizo didn't stand out that much, I guess. The fruit side was a bit worse for wear, although I understand it's not the season for lots of brunch fruit. I am lowkey suspecting my coffee might have been part decaf, or maybe it was watered down? Didn't feel very strong. Maybe will go for some alcohol next time instead.Again, good for casual brunch - I wouldn't bring a foodie with expectations, but great vibes, friendly prices (for SF) and ambience if you're getting brunch to be social.",248,1341,97
"Pretty noisy and a tad pricey, but a good place to meet up for lunch in the Castro. The pizzas and little gem salad don't take a big bite out of your wallet.",33,157,15
"Everything was great. Ordered the mussels, broccolini, and a clam pizza, split between a friend and I. All together, it was delicious. The clam pizza didn't have too much flavor but the sauce the mussels were cooked in was the right addition to drag a slice of pizza through to make it more enjoyable. The broccolini was delish, def add it to your order.The waiter and ambiance of the restaurant were nice. We sat outside in a covered area which I believe was heated too so it was comfy even on a cold night. Service was quick but they weren't pesty about checking in. Drink-wise, my friend had a tasty passion fruit cocktail and I ordered an NA IPA beer which would do the job if you need an NA beer to enjoy.",133,710,61
"Love the food, service and ambience.  Bar program has some excellent street cred! Great neighborhood restaurant -- their chicken liver paté is super d.",24,151,6
"My friend took me out for my birthday here. Ambiance was cute. We both ordered their burger. I was totally disappointed. The meat was very dry and blend and the bun was cold, the bacon was too dry as well had had bo taste. The burger was not cheap so I would expect a very good quality if I'm paying that price fir a burger. The fries was not hot neither. Service by the young girl was 5 star food did not meat the mark. Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is for our server. Do better food Starbelly!",99,496,39
"Came here for SF Restaurant Week 2022! The lunch comes with a starter and an entree for $15! What a DEAL. I ordered the 1/2 liver pate plate and chicken po'boy. The pate was a great deal - it came with a toasted piece of bread, pate, jam, and mustard. I should have ordered another slice of bread! The chicken po'boy was a good size and chicken had a tasty flavor but the slaw was a little bitter to me! Stop a great meal for $15!",86,430,32
"I actually love Starbelly.  The reservations are easy to make and the food is yummy.  The ambiance is nice- elevated casual and the service is very friendly.  Parking is a bit of a pain in the Castro if you don't get dropped off by Lyft. DINNERPate- delicious.  Not all people are into pate, but if you are- you have to try itCrispy fried brussel sproutsFresh spaghetti- The spaghetti is my favorite dish herePizza margheritaAll in all, the portions are on the smaller side.  I don't have a super large appetite, but I feel like I still leave here on the hungry.  I've only come for dinner, but I think this is better known for brunch.",115,635,50
Ambiance is really great. Food is good and well-priced. Recommend sharing and getting pizzas. Service is great and food is always timely.,22,137,7
"Maybe I'm just not a fan of New American food or I'm a snobby San Francisco foodie now. But I feel like the standard for pizza and hamburgers are pretty high in the city. The food wasn't bad but it didn't do anything for me, tasted like something was missing. Or maybe just tasted too healthy so it was stripped of its debaucherous origins. This place seems really popular though so maybe the secret is to down a few cocktails first to ""loosen"" up your tastebuds. Maybe that was our mistake but its safe to say that the food was not the star of the show (babdum tsk)",108,566,49
"A little hit or miss, but staple of the neighborhood and the right choice most of the time.  Great atmosphere, including the Parklet and sidewalk seating but hope the service has improved. Food is good, and the price is reasonable, but don't go if you're pressed for time",48,271,23
"A very unremarkable brunch! Not bad, but not great, so a solid 3. The marguerita pizza was hard on the bottom and chewy on top. The chicken and waffles was just fine, the chicken was pretty crispy on the outside. I enjoyed the salty dog cocktail. Nice elderflower flavor comes through and pairs well w/ the gin and grapefruit. The tea for two was bitter, would not reorder. Service was good. There is seating on the front and back patio, and inside in the main dining area.",87,473,33
"Walked in here to get brunch on a Sunday, and ended up waiting for about half an hour, which was decent given the popularity of this place.We ordered a couple cocktails to begin with, and they came out p quick. Taste was a solid 7/10 on both.Next we got the fish tacos, french toast and a dish called the loco moco, which is essentially a beef patty topped with a runny egg.The fish tacos were crunchy, fatty, and made helluva brunch. The french toast tasted super satisfying, but the amount of calories on that plate, my god. The loco moco was a good balance, and the patty was cooked as I had asked for, the egg had a nice mouthfeel, and the rice made it a complete dish.The portion sizes on each was good, and is enough for an adult, unless you go splitsies. The waitstaff was warm and the ambience was very welcoming. Definitely a go-go!10/10 would go back again!",161,867,69
"Mission Fig Pizza: figs, arugula, serrano ham and manchego cheese. Pretty good but just a little dry. Could've used some balsamic glaze or something. Chicken and waffles: chicken was just okayLoco Moco: one of the highlights of the meal but also small portionedPo Boy: loved the fries, slaw was good, chicken was okay Honestly thought the food was just okay, nothing super memorable. I liked the pizza the most but honestly wish there was a glaze on it because it was kind of dry.Service: sitting outside, we had a hard time getting the server's attention. Reservations: super easy to make through YelpDrinks: mimosas with grapefruit or orange juice, nice and refreshing",111,670,42
"Solid food, good atmosphere and fast service. Friendly, down home feel. Highly recommend.",13,89,2
"Super cozy spot in the Castro area! The small plates were particularly good -- I really liked the potato dumplings. The pizza was alright, but next time I think I'd order more of the sharing plates!Dined: June 29, 2022",39,218,9
"Probably should have made reservations on a Sunday evening, but thankfully, some seats opened up at the bar and they were able to seat us pretty quickly. We had the chicken liver pâté, which was out-of-this-world! That grilled bread was so good all on its own and paired with the pâté, fresh mustard seeds, and jam/jelly on the side just knocked it out of the park. The Starbelly bacon pizza just elevated the experience even further. The bacon with the arugula, jalapenos and that green goddess sauce (OMG) was the perfect blend of savory, bitter, spicy, and tangy. It looks like they change up their menus seasonally, so I'm long overdue for another visit. Until then!",116,670,49
"Tasty fried chicken sandwich, I like things saucy and would have preferred more slaw. Bun was good. Fries reminded me of In N Out. Wish they remembered the aioli for my takeout order. Not crowded at lunch.",37,205,11
"My friend was having his birthday dinner here and there were about 16 of us. They are definitely good at accommodating bigger parties. We had a pleasant experience throughout the dinner. When he made the reservation, they required us to put our order ahead of time and it was a set menu for all of us. The set menu costs $50 per person without drinks included. For starters, we had the chicken liver pate and the crab & burrata dumplings. Then we were served starbelly salad. Pizza margherita fresh spaghetti with starbelly bacon, salsa verde marinated bavette steak skewers, date& toffee cake. I think the set menu, food portion and service along with cocktails were worth the price.",118,684,40
"This place just keeps getting better.The bar menu is wonderful, so many creative concoctions. The food menu covers all the bases, small to medium to large to ginormous, as in pizza for 1. Great service, attentive and helpful.One of the best in the 'hood.Enjoy!",44,260,16
"Came for lunch last week, sat inside at a tall table. Great people watching spot. The cocktail menu is interesting, inventive. Wonderful food menu, so many cuisines on offer, Hawai'i, Mexico, USA, Asia, and nice wines too. Friendly helpful service, very good prices.Enjoy!",43,272,8
"Today was an 'off' day @ Starbelly for me.Waiter so busy chatting up other tables, and finally our table. ""Know what you want?"" Wasn't the greeting I'd hoped for. Drinks finally appear after 10 minute wait in a non-busy room...and then our food and my Loco Moco is drenched in soy sauce, way too much such that the dish is pretty awful. Move food to slope of serving bowl and hope for best. Later, check comes but waiter never asked about our meal or dessert...we order dessert...An off day, an off meal...",92,506,36
"Came here after it first opened and thought it OK but crowded and the service was rushed. Couple more times by and not as busy and service better. Both times food was good.Today, at lunch, great service, not crazy busy or loud and the food was excellent, every dish that was brought to the table was well composed and well made with excellent ingredients.Bravo, gang, so glad you are here in the 'hood!",73,402,35
"Starbelly is a great spot in Castro for dinner with friends. We really enjoyed the selection of vegetable plates. We ordered the crispy fried brussels sprouts, warm beets & goat cheese, lollo rosa salad and the house made thai spiced pork sausages. It was all delicious. We also enjoyed the passionflower and chumbo picante cocktails.",55,334,14
"Weekend brunch is where it's at! I have a sensitive stomach and always order the chilaquiles, which are perfectly seasoned without being too heavy or salty. Good mix of chips, chorizo, egg, salsa. The side salad and avocado help balance everything out. I've also been here for lunch and dinner multiple times. Pizza is hit or miss, skip the fried chicken. They seem to always have space available for two people to walk in, but for larger groups definitely reserve. The back patio is covered so it's not windy but still has ventilation. Bonus: there's an option to use the InKind app to pay, which is completely contactless and you don't have to wait for the server.",117,666,46
GREAT brunch spot especially with a bigger group!  The restaurant was very spacious and saw they were able to accommodate larger parties. The three of us decided to split several dishes and none of them disappointed. My favorite was the margherita pizza,42,253,15
"The ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and the staff were super friendly. I ordered the lavender lemonade and the chicken & waffles for brunch. The lemonade was a bit bitter and I could not really taste the lavender. The waffles were light and fluffy and had syrup already soaked into them which tasted so good. I was not a fan of the chicken. It was a bit rubbery which grossed me out. Parking is a bit of a pain around here too, alas welcome to the city.",89,461,40
"On our weekly date night, we decided to grab some dinner at Starbelly as it's always a great choice when dining in the Castro. Located on one of the busiest intersections, it's super accessible. I love the space! Lots of options for dining - outside seating in the front and the back patio, bar and high top seating, and a proper in-house dining area for tables. There's a climate and seat preference for everyone. The menu is seasonal and packed with locally sourced ingredients. Here's what we got off the winter dinner menu 2022: - Rose of Pinot Noir - Latransa for $48 a bottle- House-made chicken liver pate for $12. It's on a board with bread, sweet onion marmalade, and grain mustard. I love a good charcuterie board with different items; this was great! I also love that they bring more bread upon request- Grilled bavette steak for $30. While it comes with potato puree, we opted to get the french fries instead. The place also included crispy brussels sprouts and garlic porcini butter. So good! Love the flavors and am glad we got the fries! As mentioned, Starbelly is always a great place and option while visiting the Castro. Great food always!",204,1157,68
"One of my favorite restaurants in this neighborhood. I love their food and their drinks are very unique and yummy. My favorites for breakfast is their French Toast, for lunch I love their salads and chicken sandwich, for dinner I love their Spaghettis and any of their pizzas. All of their deserts are to die for but my favorite is the date cake.My favorite part of this restaurant is their friendly staff and their back patio/garden. It feels like I'm in Europe.",82,463,38
Restaurant week 10/21 to 10/30/22 yay! Starbelly my favorite choice but only Monday to Friday.  $15 lunch.  I love their pate which is half an order of their regular menu.  It is enough!  Love the jam with the pate.  The po boy fried chicken was excellent.  Got too gung ho and burned the roof of my mouth.  There's only limited time to get back to work.  Rushy rushy.  Big yum.,70,378,24
"Came on the first day of eating out in their patio. Very conscious of social distance, sanitizer, and cleanliness.  Highlights, of course the chicken pate, brussel sprouts, and the fried chicken sandwich.  Skip the quinoa and thin frrench fries. Their menu was limited but they said thdy will expand. They are most welcoming bunch.",54,331,20
"Annual event that i look forward to.  Restaurant week. Only 10 days to find time to sneak out of work for lunch. It's terrible to have a job that you cannot properly enjoy lunch away. But sneak i did! And it was totally worth it.  I needed an accomplice who would enjoy the experience with me and also to drive me back like Fast and Furious. I got to restaurant, 15 min after they open. Seated in the backyard.sunny day. Everybody was ordering the special, $15.15 for 3 course lunch.  Lentil soup and chicken liver. So good. The entree took awhile. Had to flag down to ask. Worth the wait since the po boy chicken was juicy and crunchy on a big bun. Mediterranean plate with hummus , falafel, and pita, pickled zucchini. Very healthy.  The best is the caramel pot de cream. Smooth and burnt flavor. So good. Worth the stress of going back to work. AVIDAZEN!.",158,858,50
"Came here for the dine about.  I know, im finally getting to 5his review.  It was a last minute surprise by a friend who came to pick me up for their last day. It was so worth it. Can't remember what we had but my memory is telling me we were drooling waitingvfor the good to come.  Food was fresh. Excellent service.  So welcoming.  We had fun during our ""work"" lunch.",71,369,31

"I have no complaints about the food, except that in my portion of the tuna there was a lump of a date from someone's dessert. Very crowded and noisy. Not recommended.",31,166,16
"Let me just say, their Starbelly bacon pizza was EVERYTHING. Whatever the green goddess dressing that was on the pizza was spectacular! ($17)Their house-made chicken liver pâté was so delicious. The amount of pâté they gave you was so generous, we had to get extra buttered bread to finish it off! It also came with a side of sweet onion marmalade and green mustard. ($12)For their spring menu, they are currently serving house-made andouille sausage and gulf prawns w/ wild rice, okra and sweet peppers. (1 big sausage and 4 prawns) It had a medley of everything and I thoroughly enjoyed it! ($28) Both cocktails were great. We got the strawberry alarm clock and a banana drink that i unfortunately forgot what's it called! ($11-13)I will be back!",128,748,45
"YUM! I tried this place for SF restaurant week and fell in love. The ambiance is amazing and their outdoor patio is very cute. The servers are friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! My favorite dish had to be the cauliflower soup -- it was so creamy and AMAZING. All of the food tastes very light and clean. I was in awe of how they managed to make every taste so good without it feeling too oily or unhealthy like many restaurants do. This place is a great spot for a date or quick lunch break during work!",100,520,42
Great service and solid menu. Always a fan of the brussel sprouts during dinner service. The chorizo pizza is perfect for late breakfast /early lunch. Don't forget the chicken and waffles,31,187,9
"It's an almost perfect neighborhood restaurant. It is almost as good as Chow used to be. They serve breakfast/brunch lunch & dinner, Southern Italian style pizzas, homemade pate which we loved, salads. Drawbacks? Wish they had some lower-priced items.",39,251,10
"Came here before a show at Castro Theater and had some really yummy pizza! There's a nice covered back patio area filled with beautiful plants which made for a great ambiance. We were told our table was limited to 1 hr 15 min, but I don't remember if they actually enforced that. I was happy to see there was a corn pizza, and it was enough to have leftovers for later! Also if you haven't tried corn on pizza yet that's something you NEED to try",86,446,37
Great service and solid menu. Food is reasonably priced with a good portion and wonderful flavor. The staff is nice. Service is fast. The ambiance is upbeat. We had a great experience!,32,184,10
"Great ambiance! Really cute place and had good drinks. We ended up getting a pizza and burger - both were good. I don't have much to complain about but I wouldn't say the food took my breathe away or anything, it was just average/above average. But mixed with a good ambiance and good service, I'd probably come here again and maybe try something else on the menu!",67,364,27
"The service was very nice. The waiters were friendly. The butternut squash pizza is a 10 out of 10 I would highly recommend. Very flavorful and unique. The crust was thin, but nicely crunchy. The chicken Po boy sandwich was very good. They set a lot of fries. Had some left over but finished it. You have to order the fries separately though. I think it's like two bucks, but it was worth it couldn't hear the waiter though he is very soft. outdoor seating heater was on. Very modern very San Francisco.",93,503,32
"Good people, food is always good, the patio is amazing. Make sure to come early!",15,80,4
Looking for a last minute dinner reservation and I was happy to be able to come here. The staff is great and the service is really fast.  We decided to share several small plates and one main entree.  The burrata was good but the bread was too soft.  The pate was really good.  The lamb meatballs were delicious.  The starbelly salad was good but slightly overdressed.  Finished up with the shrimp and andouille sausage and rice with okra.  This was all really good. The okra was cooked nice which isn't always easy to do.  It had a great taste overall and although super buttery it was so good.  Overall it's a nice place and I would go back if I lived here.,122,659,44
"My friends and I went for brunch. We got the chicken po boy with fries, the Italian eggs, and the chilaquiles. I tried a little bit of the three and I thought the best was the Italian eggs. The chilaquiles were good, too, but not something I'd get if I go next time. The chicken po boy was disappointing -- the fried chicken tasted unseasoned and kind of soggy (or wasn't as crispy as it looked like). The vibes were good but the food was OK. As for the service, the staff felt a little all over the place -- which is kind of understandable given it was height brunch time on a weekend.It took a while for us to get someone's attention and felt a little rushed at the end when we wanted to stay longer but was told the table had to be used for a different reservation.",150,768,63
"Wonderful place, such a gem I hope to be back next time in San Fran. Amazing service, friendly staff, delicious food, beautiful atmosphere, and string drinks. What more could you ask for?! I loved the decor and the vibes the food was so good too! I can't recommend this place enough.",51,283,15
"I just came here about two weekends ago for Saturday Brunch. I have gone here prior for dinner with friends. But, it actually was a 4 star experience. I think the reason for the 5 is because of the service.The brunch drinks are delicious. I had a strawberry drink that was pretty strong and we all ordered them. As far as food this is what we indulged:- Pizza with Bacon and sausage- Chorizo Chilaquiles-- these were okay nothing to die for, I would probably get the pizza for myself next time.- My friend had the 2 farmhouse eggs, potatoes and a breakfast sausage.Overall it was a good experience because of their outside area and the service was spectacular. :)",119,663,52
"Starbelly is a casual restaurant in the Castro. We came here for brunch on a weekend and it was surprisingly not packed and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Do note that they take reservations by phone if you have a larger party.The brunch menu has classic American brunch dishes with some more unique options. The Fried Chicken & Waffles has to be my favorite. It comes with two large portions of flavorful and crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy buttermilk waffles. It's flavorful and filling. The farmhouse eggs with potatoes and bacon is also a good option. Their potatoes and bacon are very crispy, which I enjoyed.The venue was cute and spacious. The service could have been a bit better, however. We received the incorrect order and it took a bit for it to be corrected. The food was then sent to another table rather than being discarded. The check also took a while to receive.",159,901,68
"Such a nice experience for our first date. Very busy, but they got us in quickly. Service was amazing! You must try the Pate'  and the burger. Ambience was comfortable, but a bit noisy; always a good sign.   Looking forward to my next visit!",45,241,16
"Star belly is super cute inside and has a really pretty back patio to sit on! Going for lunch is the best time to sit out as it is warm but usually not windy. The fried chicken po boy and the shrimp tacos were great, as well as the pate appetiser (if you like pate). The date and toffee cake that they have is also super yummy, it is definitely worth stopping here for lunch if you're in the Castro!",80,399,35
"Nestled just off Market near the Castro this place has a heated back patio, inside seating and a parklet out front for folks who run warm. Came here with a friend and we both got the Gentleman Caller - a bourbon based drink with vermouth and twist of lemon. We also ordered the star belly salad, Caesar salad and the mission fig pizza. Both salads were yummy but nothing to write home about. The mission fig pizza was divine and it seemed really popular based on the servers comments. Figs, arugula, and some ham - it was so good!Wrapped up our time here with the toffee cake with mascarpone and dates - delicious.",113,614,45
"Service here is horrendous. Waiter was incompetent. Might as well get traffic cones and put QR codes on them. It might be different outside the happy hour time, but a terrible experience during HH. The drinks are mid. My burger order came out incorrect and tasted flavorless. For the fries, I am pretty sure they get the worst potatoes and fry them to a crispy oily mess.",67,371,22
Reliably great food and friendly service in a nice atmosphere. Love to sit outside on a nice weekend day for brunch.,21,116,7
"Love this neighborhood spot! Friendly staff and with well spaced tables. Comfortable bar seating, everything coming out food/ drink looked very fresh! The bar had herbs and fruit that looked like it was cut that day. Bloody Mary hit the spot and the fish tacos were perfect!",47,274,15
Great food and great service! Their ingredients are fresh and delicious and the outside patio is romantic.,17,106,6
"This great restaurant has: Astounding service.....Delicious food....eclectic patio space and park let seating....and marvelous creation cocktails.  My husband and I drove from Petaluma to have a pre-holiday lunch with our daughters.  They seated the girls right away even though we were a bit late and, I really appreciate this small cordial touch.The menu has an array of temptations for your pallet...f salads, pate, pizzas, home made chorizo, breakfast lunch and more. The cocktails are on the back of the menu. Do not miss out. My husband snd I split the Fried Chicken Po boy with Spicy slaw and, corn meal crusted fish tacos with slaw that melts in your mouth. Both come with pickled jalapeños too.  Our girls ordered the pork belly sauced pasta and a burger.Best of all......we ordered a group basket of their fries....do not miss the fries . This comes with 3 dipping sauces.  I'm so impressed. Every bite was a burst of flavor. The burger and the chicken came on challah buns. This is so smart.  I am Super impressed. We all were. The only suggestion we have is, please move the tables apart.  We were really close to a lot of people. I know the vaccines were checked but, with new virus....not comfortable completely",209,1225,64
"This place is pure magic..how the tiny kitchen and small staff are able to accommodate such a huge space is beyond me. The chill severs and relaxed vibe make this a neighborhood go to. The dishes are simple and oh so comforting. The menu changes seasonally but there are staples that you can always count on being there...the fresh spaghetti, pizzas and burgers are popular favorites, and every iteration of the decadent dumplings are a must try. This is one of the few places you can go in the winter and sit outside and really be cozy. The wide selection of tables/ atmospheres means there's a place that everyone will love. The back patio is either fully or partially covered, giving you the experience of being outside but with the warmth of huge heat lamps. I've found it's actually sometimes warmer there in the winter months than inside even. It's also the most happening section in the whole place. I've heard you can rent it out for private events and I can't wait to plan a party there. The parklet tables on the street are like your own private oasis..warm to the point where you'll shed your jacket even on the coldest nights. Inside offers both high top tables, standard seating and a huge communal table. Spots at the bar are great for cocktails and convo with their fun and friendly bartenders. It's very easy to get a reservation and they almost always are able to accommodate walk ins. Parking can be a bit challenging in that hood..but a couple spins around the block usually lands you a spot. I've never had brunch there but the dinner experience is fabulous. You'll find yourself being a regular there for sure :)",290,1633,120
"Excellent food. And they are doing well in the beverage department. Their bar hist , Adam Scott, is amazing. Their outdoor patio area is the best for entertaining one or a whole group.",33,184,11
"Love this place! For a a great spaghetti (all of their other dishes are good but the spaghetti is my absolute favorite!) and a nice spot to go on your own, with friends or family this place does not disappoint.",40,210,21
"Starbelly pizza is delicious, can't wait to come back. We stopped by after some drinks and of coarse we ended up drinking even more. The food and service was phenomenal.",30,169,11
"Starbelly is pretty cool! We began our meal with cocktails. My gf ordered the Strawberry Alarm Clock and I asked the waiter if they could make me something with Scotch, and they brought me Penicillin (the cocktail, not the antibiotic). Both were on point - and I was especially pleased with the Penicillin because this was not on the menu (but the waiter was correct that they had great bartenders ay Starbelly).For appetizers, we shared garlic fries and sweet potato dumplings. Also on point. Fries were hot and sufficiently garlicky, and unlike what appears to be popular at most restaurants, these were thicker fries (almost steak fries) that nonetheless maintained a slight crisp (without being crunchy) - anyway, they were above average. The dumplings were magic, savory and smooth with a touch of sweetness and great mouthfeel.I ordered a steak and my gf ordered a burger. My steak was good, if a bit more cooked than I wanted (I asked for medium-rare, and it was on the well done side of medium). The mashed potatoes that came with it were smooth as silk and tasted wonderful and the brussels made for an excellent sidekick. The burger was solid. As for non-edibles, the wait staff was lovely and the space is great. We sat inside, which had light and tasteful holiday decorations, but the patio looked cool, too. We hope to come back for brunch sometime.",235,1362,97
"Met a friend here, her 1st time.Thankfully we went early and missed the the Mommy Daddy Baby crowd and the later louder crowd.So we pretty much had the place to ourselves.Service was great and very attentive, sadly, I don't know the fellas' name, my friend has the receipt.We started with the Chicken Liver Pate which was outstanding and a very generous portion and plenty of toast points to go with. Though we had to ask for my onion Chutney, not enough for the whole serving - $14.00Next up my favorite the Starbelly Bacon Jalapeno pizza w/Green Goddess dressing - $18 = 8 large slices, plenty. This one was a bit of a fail this time (1st time, as I've had it many times). Too heavily garnished with arugula but the bigger issue was it was way too heavy on the tomato sauce, which lended to a very soggy wet pizza in the middle and 1st bite, everything slid right off. Plus, it was really skimpy on the bacon. Graciously, after mentioning this to our server, they made us a brand new pizza, minimal sauce, more or the right amount of bacon and cooked more ""well done"". I shall remember this next time I have a pizza.I will return but did want to mention this about the pizza. If you too experience this, ask them to re-do.",226,1224,95
"One of my all time ""go to"" places in the city for consistently good food, decent service and the prices won't break your bank.LOVE the patio space, though it can get rather loud.So far I've introduced 5 friends to Starbelly, and now it's on their list.My fave food there is the Pizza. Especially the bacon, jalapeño, arugula & green goddess dressing pizza. It is pretty spicy though, just warning all.I tried the mixed chicories & arugula, pear, dates, smoked almonds  & blue cheese salad. Nice presentation, ample portion. Could have used a wee bit more dressing.I also tried the Bibb lettuce, green goddess dressing, grilled chicken, bacon & cherry tomatoes salad. First time it was FAB. Second time, I don't know, the ingredients were pretty skimpy (IMP)!I did not find the non alcoholic beverages to be that tasty. The description's sounded better than they really were. None had much ""punch or unique taste"".All in all a good place to dine alone or with friends.",164,967,51
"I stopped by for a pan seared halibut with asparagus risotto and a cocktail. As many others have said, the interior design of the place is modern, warm and inviting. The actual food, for me, was middling but certainly edible - everything was underseasoned, the fish was just a bit overcooked, but the presentation was inviting. Standards don't need to be so high for this level of restaurant, but San Francisco prices always make me feel like my dining choices are precious.",81,474,34
"I love their spaghetti! Probably the best spaghetti I have ever had. The perfect amount of spice, flavor, and sauce. I really enjoyed the bacon, it feels more like thin cuts of pork-belly lol.  The only problem is that I wish I had more! This should be enough to get you coming thought the doors. I also lucky ordered their fries as an app (I know carbie barbie), but it was worth it! Three dipping sauces all good, maybe adding another exotic sauce? Not needed, but would be appreciated. Parking is a bit hard over here, but make the trip, you'll like it!",103,556,33
"Came here for brunch with my bestie since a nearby brunch spot that we originally wanted to go to had an almost 1 hour wait. SO glad we came here instead! The vibes were amazing - beautiful decor, friendly staff, and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Didn't need a reservation to sit inside since they had space (it was a Saturday, late morning), though I've heard it can get  busy..maybe we were just super lucky. I ordered the chilaquiles which came with a yummy salad and half of an avocado - loved it! My friend got the margarita pizza which was also delicious. Food was really vibrant and flavors were amazing. Totally recommend checking this spot out!",118,661,42
"We were looking for a late brunch/ lunch spot and this meal did not disappoint! The cocktail list was great, my favorite was the doctor's orders which was especially good. This chicken and waffles is the best I've got in a long time!  Chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffles were superb. The roasted corn pizza is a seasonal item but wow was it great! Really interesting and complex flavors, the crust was perfect.",74,419,30
"Always delicious, love their outdoor back patio. Huge fan of the crispy Brussels sprouts.",14,89,3
"I really really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it didn't hit the spot, or maybe it was an off night? My friends and I got the fries, potato dumplings, Brussels sprouts, chorizo pizza; and the spaghetti. The fries came unseasoned and also a little cold, and the sauces were nothing too special. The potato dumplings were decent, but a little too much cheese for someone like myself (not necessarily a bad problem to have). The Brussels sprouts came overly burnt as well. The chorizo pizza wasn't anything special, but the spaghetti was okay. Overall, disappointing due to the amount of good reviews they have, and the cocktails were also mid.",112,655,41
"You have to love this busy restaurant. You can choose to sit at the communal table or at a high top table for two. The food is outstanding - especially the pate and the pizzas. The choices are hand prepared, earthy and prepared with the highest quality ingredients.We over ordered from the mini dishes, but were happy with every selection.",60,339,25
"This has become one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  Besides the food being excellent - we love the white bean purée, as well as the pasta appetizers....   and steak for main entree - the service is great.  The service here is top notch.  It hasn't mattered who is our server, this is an extremely well run restaurant.  Orders go in and food comes out pretty quickly.  Someone is always checking on your table and proactively refilling water, etc.  Its clearly a well orchestrated team effort rather than one person doing everything for your table, and it works well. Last time we went we tried out the back patio.  It was much quieter than the main restaurant and still had decent airflow but with heat lamps.   Very pleasant.  We got there at 530 pm and there was hardly anyone there.   By the time we left, it was about half full but I know this location gets much busier around 7.",164,898,61
"First time at Starbelly was an experience that I could only describe as delightful. Atmosphere was lovely on the back patio with music at a perfect volume so conversations wouldn't get lost, and it was very well shaded. I had the white sangria and the fried chicken po'boy off the summer brunch menu. The sandwich and fries were divine, but unfortunately, the sangria was nothing to phone home about. It could've used some more cut fruit and a fuller flavor palate. But overall, everything was very good! Service was great and we were there for a friend's birthday so they gave her a dessert with a candle...so cute. I'd highly recommend Starbelly if you're looking for a chill brunch spot!",120,690,53
"This is such a neighborhood standby. We've been coming here for years, even before we moved to this area. It's easy to get reservations, the food (chicken liver pate with that bread!) and cocktails are always good. They have quite a bit of seating thru their deep restaurant, including the lovely back patio! We've brought friends and family here, and it's always a hit. Easy pick.",66,381,25
"Went here for dinner without reservations on Sunday night with a small dog. I like the outdoor patio area in the back. It was unusually windy that evening, but the patio set up blocked all the wind! Service was great. No rush at all. The food here is good, not salty. We ordered the grilled Moroccan-spiced lamb meatballs, pan roasted PEI mussels with chorizo, butter bean puree with herb flat bread, and mixed chicories & arugula salad with, pear, dates, smoked almonds & blue cheese. I have also been here for brunch previously and ordered chicken and waffles. Yum!",99,567,30
"Starbelly lived up to the brunch hype that it has! I got to try a variety of dishes because I came with a group, which made it an even better experience for me.I'm usually content with a simple french toast, but the challah french toast was SO delicious. The mascarpone and pistachio combination was so good (and I've never seen pistachio on french toast). The italian eggs were also so well seasoned. I wanted to eat more of this dish, it was so well cooked. The butternut squash pizza was also delicious, but I think the brunch foods stole the show for me!",103,558,38
"Have been here a few times and have enjoyed each experience. The starbelly bacon pizza and house cut fries are a staple. While I normally don't order desserts, I've had a few here and very much enjoyed them. Depending on the day and time, the noise levels can get a bit high. Just something to be mindful of depending on occasion.",61,330,27
"This small, and relaxed atmosphere restaurant is presented on a bustling 4 corner section in the Mission district.  You will notice wine bottles crisscrossed in the windows as you walk up, which was a marker for me, and super cool.  The service is top notch.  We were greeted, and received caring service throughout the meal by thoughtful staff.  And be prepared to be presented a small double page menu that packs a great selection of delicious food, and drink options.  Seriously, everything was amazing, and we are going back today!  You are given the choice of bubbly or still water, had to go with the complimentary bubbly water, because bubbles.  We started with the bean puree dish, and the marinated olives which had a delicate flavor of star anise which was surprisingly good. The puree bean dish had alot of flavor between the white bean puree, and the slightly pickled tasting veggies.  I want to go back for that dish alone.  I ordered a salty dog, and it tasted fresh like pressed grapefruit.  The best salty dog I have ever had hands down.  My husband ordered the Margherita pizza with vegan cheese, and ate the entire pizza but let me have a few bites of a slice.  It was a light, thin crust, and very fresh tasting ingredients.  Not the out of a tin can tasting sauce you are typically presented with.  I had the house made bangers, and mash.  That is the best bangers I have had outside of Europe, and I am already craving this dish again.  I ordered the toffee cake to go.  It comes with heavy cream, and candied figs.  I enjoyed it back at the hotel with a brandy sitting in front of the fireplace.  A perfecf dessert to end a perfect dinner.  If your in the area,  do yourself a favor and stop in for a memorable evening.",314,1741,123
Great service at our 11 AM weekday brunch. Breakfast brunch menu is small but easy to find some thing to please anyone. Their back deck is one of my favorites in the city.,33,171,12
"Starbelly in Engels, CA is a must-visit spot! Amazing American cuisine, scrumptious breakfast, and a great cocktail bar. The ambiance is charming and the service is top-notch.",27,175,9
"Came here for a team dinner that was very well organized! We were able to customize a set menu ahead of time and the food came out at a nice pace.FOOD- Pizza margherita: simple and yummy- House cut fries with three dips: particularly tasty because we were so hungry lol. My coworkers and I couldn't figure out what the green dip was but it was yummy- Fresh spaghetti: simple and tasty! Spaghetti was cooked to perfect al-dente texture- Seared Ahi tuna: Loved the crispy broccoli di ciccio. The ahi tuna itself was a bit overcooked which was a bit disappointing- Salted caramel pot de creme: surprisingly very tasty given that I don't like caramel. The cornmeal-rosemary cookies were a huge hit across the team-  Chocolate toffee cake with dates and mascarpone: also very delicious!DRINKSOur team had a good selection of wine. We also ordered a variety of cocktails which all looked pretty. I tried the Salty Dog which had all the flavors I like and was perfect for me.Overall, good venue for a team event. Food is simple but tasty and it was pretty busy on a Tuesday evening.",189,1075,73
"I always get the green goddess pizza with an egg or the burger doc's style (pate and grilled onions). So yummy! The service is always impeccable and the ambiance reminds me of a modern architectural magazine that hipsters love to emulate: wood paneling, plants, steel, etc. A neighborhood gem that I will revisit time and time again.",57,333,17
"The menu is so bizarre!! Unless you're having the burger or a pizza (and this is honestly not the place to get pizza given the incredible options around the city), options are weirdly limited--esp for me bc I don't eat pork (my ONLY restriction). I've been numerous times over the years because friends wanted to go, its before an event at the Castro theater, etc, and every time I'm dumbfounded by the menu. That's my experience but please look up the menu and check it out for yourself to see if it works for you. It's great if you're ok having a small salad (always good) and a veggie side dish, and/or the duck terrine w grilled bread, which is outstanding. I really would love to be able to say this place is great neighborhood gem, but whenever I'm there I always question why I'm there again (which is my bad). The setting/atmosphere is great--for me it's just about the items they choose to list on the menu.",168,916,75
"Starbelly gets 5 stars from my belly. Every dish I had was satisfying. I will drive to SF from Vallejo just to eat here again. The staff was friendly and accommodating and attentive. The interior was cute and they have outdoor dining in the front and in the back with heat lamps if you're concerned about COVID like me. But back to the food and drinks. We had the Dungeness  crab & garlic with squid ink noodles, fries, a star belly salad, Margherita pizza, and a lychee blossom cocktail--and all of it was devoured with nothing left to take home.  Parking was easy on a Saturday night also. Thank you for great service and food made with love.",118,644,48
Classic spot for great food and a community vibe. The back seating area is worth the extra wait.,18,96,5
"Loveeeeed the place! Everything was amazing. I wish they had bigger brunch menu, but that's just me",17,99,7
Came with a group for dinner and ordered the Citrus Salad and Bavette Steak (subbed the potato purée for fries) -- both were very good. Loved the crispy brussels! Service was prompt and atmosphere was lively.,36,208,15
I have lived in the neighborhood for years and usually enjoyed the food here but the service is a deal breaker for me.  Most of the time me and my friends go here we stand at the front door for 5-10 minutes while several employees behind the bar (right in front of the door) proceed to ignore us.  Then we often get attitude from the servers and the service is very slow.  It's too bad because there aren't a ton of restaurants in the neighborhood with decent food but I can't go back here and put up with the cold shoulder and attitude anymore.  I'm done!,106,556,51
"Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere and location. Great service. My favorites are the Burger, and Spaghetti (yummy bacon), and the solid red wine selections. Can not go wrong here! PRO TIP - Request the rear patio",35,210,8
"A great place to dine. The food is perfect and can satisfied everyone in your party. There is something in the menu for everyone. The service is a bit slow when busy, but in a good day is very attentive. I really like the indoor/ outdoor patio. It's heated and covered. Great ambiance. Also, the cocktails and wine selections are exquisite.",61,340,23
"I've been to Starbelly for both dinner and brunch and, while the food was good both times, I'd recommend going for dinner! The pate and bread, fries, burrata, and butternut squash dumplings were all so tasty. Make reservations or go early if you can, especially if you want to sit in the cute, airy back patio.",56,310,23
"Starbelly was delicious! The only critique I would give is that when my friend and I got our table, we were put in a tight corner with barely any lighting overhead. It was out on the patio, but the light was so dim we had to use our camera lights on our phone to read the menu. Not helpful when you want to order more drinks and give your waiters a good tip.",73,358,37
"Five stars for service... everyone who works here is super nice and the service is great. The location is great and the restaurant has a cool vibe. Now the big problem is the food is boring and not that flavourful. And ask any of my friends when I sit down I am going to say, ""they still haven't changed the menu."" I love this restaurant group so much I love delarossi and a mano but why is starbelly so star-boring? Even their pizza is dry and lacklustre.... Maybe for non-vegetarian there are some good options but their veggie burger is dry and boring. I try to talk my friends out of going there when they choose it...",117,622,54
"Good food, cool restaurant but where is the service? No plate with my pizza and had to go in and ask for everything we needed. The host was cool but then we barely saw any staff after we were seated, unusual for a restaurant.... too bad.",46,237,24
"Starbelly is a comfortable go-to in the neighborhood with quality food, drinks, and an outdoor deck (along with seating outside in front in the parklet. I have only eaten brunch there, and recommend the chilaquiles and bottle of Prosecco with OJ for you and your party!",46,269,22
"The food wasn't great. Nothing was outright bad, but nothing made me happy. And it's not cheap. I wouldn't go back. Staff were nice and the ambiance was decent - they have a cute back patio. But you can find much better food elsewhere in the area",47,246,18
"My girlfriends and I been wanting to try them for brunch.  We opted for outdoor seating and they had our table ready!  Yay for a heater overhead since SF weather can be so unpredictable.  We always order to share, and today, we had:sunnyside joe's, lost coast ground beef, cheddar, onions & spinach, potatoeschallah French toast, market fruit conserve, mascarpone & pistachiobuttermilk fried chicken & waffles, maple syrupstarbelly salad with leaf lettuce, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, salt & pepper vinaigrettePizza: grilled summer corn, aged white cheddar, Aleppo chile, lime aioli & cilantroEVERYTHING was good.  The pizza was a nice surprise.  We also really liked sunnyside joe's.  Service was prompt and the staff came to check on us a few times.",119,753,29
"I went to Starbelly with my friend on Sunday at 2pm so there was no wait and the food was delicious! Ask to sit in the back patio. It is covered but has nice, fresh air and a welcoming atmosphere. We ordered the lychee drink and the berry margarita. Both were very good and would highly recommend getting the margarita! For food we ordered the arugula bacon starbelly pizza, fish tacos, and a side of fries. I highly recommend getting a pizza here and was even great as leftovers the next day. Overall, great food, cocktails, and the staff were very nice and friendly. I will be back again",109,589,46
"Let me just start by saying that this place absolutely lives up to its hype!! We came on a weekend night and were miraculously able to get seated shortly after arriving (we opted for outside/patio seating and the heaters kept us warm). We ordered dumplings for the table; however, the restaurant ran out. The manager came and apologized and proceeded to provide us with 2 free appetizers instead. One of the apps was I believe garlic broccoli. Personally, I very much so dislike broccoli, but holy molyyyy, I'm not sure how the chef prepared this dish but it was the best broccoli I have tasted in my life! My main course was the seared tuna and that did not disappoint either. Pair that with a delicious drink and I was set for the night. Thoroughly impressed with the food and even more so with the excellent service! Also, if you plan on continuing the night with more drinking, the restaurant is walking distance from a whole bunch of bars!",169,944,72
"Starbelly has a really cute outdoor patio and cozy ambiance! Also a fantastic location in the heart of SF. For vegan eaters: it's a salad and fries situation. But go for the drinks and bring your not vegan friends, they will surely like it.",44,240,17
"I ordered the fish tacos and you can add on fries or a salad for $2 more. In general, the food was very well priced considering there were only two tacos. In SF, you should always expect your brunch to be at least $25 including tax and tip. My meal with the fries add-on was around $19 including tax and tip. The breading on the fish was good and there was decent amount of fish. The only issue I had was that the food took a very very long time to come out. The kitchen is pretty small for the amount of seating they had. So just be aware that you may have to wait a while for your food to come out. We wanted for 45 mins.",128,623,58
I loved coming here for dinner.It was delicious and they had a unique set up.Worth a try forsure.,18,97,8
"Starbelly has remained good and consistent over the years. We had a nice frito misto to start which was a pleasant surprise with cornmeal in place of traditional coating/batter. The fig and Parma ham pizza and baby kale caesar salad was so fresh and tasty. Finished off with the warm toffee cake and pot de creme, both of which were incredible (still)....Happy to ssee a restaurant coming out of the pandemic staying consistently good....good service, tasty food, and great value.",80,480,32
Good food and nice ambiance. Service was meh. Make sure you get a reservation beforehand.,15,89,4
Great Brunch here on the patio.  We shared the fried chicken sandwich and the pizza with sausage.  The pizza was great and loved the thin crust.     The poi boy sandwich was equally terrific and the brunch cocktails were perfect.,41,229,14
"I've been coming to this place for 3 years and it's everything you could ask for in a bar with a TV, jukebox and outdoor patio. It's a great place to watch a Braves game or have a drink with friends. I was never a big Bloody Mary fan, but after seeing the bartender make some here, I had to try one ...... Wow. They are legit. Spicy mules can do that too. Lots of beer, which only adds to the appeal. Head to the back deck and you can even kill a whole day without even realizing it.",99,483,43
"What's the place to go? Starbelly! Until tonight. My partner and I have a reservation for 9:45pm. Due to a street closure caused by a motorcycle and car accident, we are forced to take a minor detour. We park, walk to Starbelly to get our usual menu items and drinks. We get to the entrance and the host says they're closed. We both say we have a 9:45 reservation (see image one). One very unfriendly male at the bar gives us attitude and says, ""it's 9:53, the kitchen is closed"". We tell him we have a 9:45 reservation, how is the kitchen closed? There's even a 10:00pm reservation available (see image two). Doesn't make sense. They just won't sit us and the unfriendly customer service was just unacceptable and didn't expect it from Starbelly staff. Every time I'm here, it's the best customer service but tonight, this one individual was very dismissive and rude. I understand it's the end of your shift and you want to go home (more like go out for this one person) but treat your patrons with respect and honor their reservation. If the kitchen closes at a certain time, the system should reflect that. I'm sorry but this was our last time at Starbelly.",209,1160,83
"Starbelly is one of my go-to lunch places in the Castro. Food is always great, service is always great, and there is a nice assortment of indoor and outdoor seating options.",31,173,13
"TL;DR - Good space for brunch with plenty of seating in the patio (back is better than the front) and lots of open space inside.Get the pizza and chicken liver/pate here, they're the best thing on the menu. Any of the pizza will do, it's all good. Both of these are easy to eat and share. The pate was divine, really, I could've just eaten that.The burger was disappointing, the description and name of the burger made it out to be better than it actually was. Overall, good service, great space, some menu items are better than most.",98,534,41
One of our favorite SF restaurants and a monthly staple at least in our household. Delicious food and drinks with a great ambiance. :-),24,135,10
"The food at Starbelly is hella yummy !!!I love  eating the fries, margherita pizza, and the bolognese spaghetti  with jalapeños and bacon !!!",23,141,7
"I love eating here. Especially post pandemic. Because there is out front, inside and outside porch seating.The food is really yummy. The burger I had today was perfection! My Margharita Verde tasted really yummy and the two desserts were amazing!",40,246,10
"Their chilaquiles are amazing and always hit the spot. As someone with a sensitive stomach, I appreciate that the dish is perfectly seasoned without being too heavy or salty. The combination of chips, chorizo, egg, and salsa is just perfect. Plus, the side salad and avocado help balance everything out. I've also visited this restaurant multiple times for lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.",66,407,23
"Really fun and open vibe in the Castro area. We started with the. White bean purée and a couple of cocktails. Our server was training, but there is a team service vibe here. You will it not be waiting long for anything. Everyone is there to serve, but you also have a contact person We had a great time and our food was really good. If something caches your eye, go ahead and order it. You will not be disappointed.",80,415,34
Same tired menu from 2011. Be seasonal or leave the neighborhood. Some nice inventive chef can take over this space from your fast food chain. I hope others follow this review and demand more from our once great neighborhood joint who all but gave up on living.,47,261,19
"Really awesome evening at Starbelly. Great space, excellent service and a variety of delicious foods.Dumplings were luscious and delicious and cheesy. Pate was soooo good. Even the toast was considered. Gazpacho was creamy and excellent. Cod was flaky and fried chicken was crispy and wonderful.Vaccine requirements started and were super simple and well handled. So good.",56,372,19
Once was great and now mediocre at best:Pizza soggy and bland;Mussels small number and many unopenedServer unfamiliar with menuOverpriced for what it isFir pizza delfina much betterAnother example of a restaurant that never opened correctly after pandemix,37,255,14
"Came here on a monday night for dinner and drinks. My party of 3 made reservations for 6:15 and got seated right away. All the staff was very nice in helping us find suitable drinks. All of us ordered drinks, I tried the strawberry alarm clock which was amazing. Fruity and sweet with little taste of alcohol. My friends ordered the salty dog  which was also a fruity drink with grapefruit. We thought the dumplings were pretty good, they came in a light buttery sauce. The mussels were also a hit. Although we thought the bread was a little underdone and chewy. We also thought the fresh spaghetti noodles were chewy and bouncy noting that we wished the sauce was a tad spicier. We loved the pizza! The fresh corn and bacon made for a smoky flavor while the fried egg provided a yummy richness. If you come here try giving the drinks and pizza a try!",157,851,56
"Haven't been here in about 10 years I think. Food is still very good!  We had the muscles and the steak. Both were very tasty.  The man who greeted us (I think he was a manager) was not very friendly or welcoming however. Kind of bad first impression. Our server was ok, but very very into himself.  Ugh. But aside from the mediocre service I would go back for the food.",71,370,30
"Friendly service, fun casual atmosphere + California comfort food was so good!Pro Tip: Call ahead to request a seat on their cute back patio, complete with palm trees! It's covered so still warm even on chilly days.We got the chicken & waffles & margherita pizza, 10/10 would recommend!",48,286,10
"Love this place.  Excellent food, friendly service, great location.  Chicken liver pate is to die for.......",16,108,3
Food is fine. Service can be better. My waiter was nice but not attentive; i had to get his attention all the time...,23,117,12
"My friends and I stopped by for dinner last night to celebrate my friend's promotion at work. We made reservations for 6 people one week in advance.  Smart idea because this place was packed yesterday! I'm talking about indoor and outdoor dining. Yes, they did follow social distancing protocols with the tables. We ordered spaghetti, Po'Boy fried chicken sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and several cocktails. The staff was attentive even though they had a lot of tables to attend to. Meals arrived promptly. Menu quite limited, but the prices are reasonable considering this is SF. We all seemed to enjoy our food. No complaints. It is a little cramped, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have a phobia of small enclosed places. Parking is limited outside since there are so many popular restaurants around the area. You might have to circle around several times to find a spot.",148,875,51
Of course we all love Starbelly. Gotta admit that corn pizza is not my favorite but everything else is great.,20,109,8
"Delicious food, great outdoor seating, excellent service and appealing ambiance. Highly recommend!",12,98,1
"WOW. Absolutely delicious and definitely want to come back (it's too dangerous we live 2 blocks away.) We were seated right away at 5pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't too busy even when we left at 6:30. The jalapeño cornbread is the most incredible cornbread I've ever had (also not spicy!) Paired with their homemade honey butter, it's *chefs kiss*The starbelly bacon pizza and sweet corn pizza are ridiculously good. The corn was so rich and the bacon so flavorful. It also wasn't spicy so if you're worried about the jalapeño, it isn't a problem!",96,545,39
"We went here for lunch on SF restaurant week. It was quite lovely. We started with the fries served with three dips. Fries were hot and crispy, but only one of the dips was anything to write home about (one was ketchup). From the prix fixe menu, I had the pate with fig jam and mustard which was very good- especially the fig jam. We both choose the Mediterranean plate as our entree. We liked it very much, but thought it could be spiced a little more heavily. Unfortunately, they brought us our entrees when were just about halfway through our appetizers- making our small tabletop crowded & uncomfortable. We also felt a bit rushed. The star of the show were the drinks and dessert! We both loved the basil cucumber limeade and the coffee was perfect! For dessert, we had the date & toffee cake, which was divine! Such a marvelous combination. The cake was not too sweet and had many layers of flavor while still a bit of a rustic type of dessert. The dates & mascarpone were such a scrumptious compliment! The rich, dark coffee was a satisfying pairing with the dessert. Covid practices were on point. Service very good. Price was reasonable. Super diverse staff & patrons (queer & POC friendly). Accessible. We ate inside and we were very far away from other tables. It felt very safe. Starbelly requires that patrons have their mask on whenever they are not eating/drinking. Outside patio and parklet also looked very inviting so will have to try that next!",260,1463,106
"Awesome food, filled with bougie staff with a pretentiousness vibe in the air. Let's just talk food:Brussels Sprouts, 4 stars. Great preparation, served crispy.Fish Tacos, 4 1/2 Stars. So delicious and loaded with fresh fish and slaw. Fries on the side were pretty great, too.Bacon Burger, 4 stars. Pretty classic, which is how I like it. The meat quality was quite good as well.Caesar Salad, 5 stars. My favorite dish. I know it's simple, but when it's done right it's so good.Great spot, would definitely give this a go for a brunch.",92,535,27
Yummy food and drinks! Best to make a reservation on open table so you don't have to wait. I needed to adjust the time was running late so I called and they accommodated me. Chicken poy boy sandwich was really good! My friend ordered the pizza and loved it. The drinks are really unique and flavorful. There isn't a private parking lot you have to park on the street but there is opened spaces near by for street parking. It is a nice walk around the Castro too. I would come again.,92,482,35
"Nice location/setting (check the back patio!), good food and friendly service. We've been there several times abs we'll be back !",21,129,5
"I ordered delivery from this place last night and it was really great!The chicken liver pâté delivers super well--the bread was soft, and the chicken pate was flavorful and creamy.I got the starbelly bacon pizza and added on prosciutto and farm eggs. This was by far the best thing I ordered. The prosciutto was legit prosciutto and I like that they didn't cook it with the pizza but added it on after. The eggs were gooey on the inside but not undercooked. The arugula added the perfect amount of bitter kick, and the tomato sauce they used was incredible.The pumpkin dumplings I did not enjoy as much as the other two dishes, unfortunately. They lacked flavor and were a little bland.All in all a great experience though, and will be ordering from them again.",134,761,56
"I've heard about this place and so glad I finally had a chance to visit! The front is very unassuming, but as you walk in, it's such an adorable space and the back patio is charming!Tis' the Xmas season, so I loved how they added ornaments to the plants and had beautiful wreaths.I enjoyed the cocktails, Strawberry Alarm Clock and The Salty Dog. Their coffee was great too.The salads are huge portions! The Bibb had slices of bacon on it, I'd recommend cutting them as the bacon weren't cooked to my liking and did not look fresh, but the salad was good. Fish tacos were a nice smallportion if you prefer to eat light, but they did have a kick! (Spicy). The pizzas were great! Good portion for two-three people. Service was great. Well staffed and friendly. I'd love to come back!",142,781,60
"Went here for brunch and sat outside.Pros: cute venue and walkable from our hotelCons: While we were seated quickly, it took over 10min for a waiter to stop by our table with water.A leaf fell out of our water pitcher while we were pouring water - it was clearly not something that was intentionally added to the drinkFood was delivered BEFORE our drinks - also the warm drinks were cold. Food was COLD This was my experience - I'm sharing because of how notably unfortunate it was and how disappointed I am - I was really looking forward to my French toast and waffles",104,569,48
"When we arrived they could not find our reservation.  Great start, folks.We were seated in the patio in the back, which was great, but it was a beautiful afternoon and they had the entire patio covered with a fabric roof, blocking out any chance of enjoying the beautiful weather.  It also defeated any Covid-prevention benefit of sitting outside.I ordered the $18 salad, which was advertised on the menu as containing ""seasonal fruit.""  It showed up with chopped apples in it.  ""Seasonal fruit"" at the very end of May would be strawberries or peaches or apricots.  Apples are not ""seasonal"" in late May, but they certainly are a lot cheaper than strawberries, peaches, or apricots, all of which are available fresh and local at farmer's markets the same week we ate here.  This was blatanant false advertising on the menu.  Just say ""apples"" if that is the cheap fruit you are going to put in your salad.The dressing was powerfully astringent.  A sweet fruit would have balanced this out a bit.  Tart apples only added to the off-taste of the salad.Service was the kind where they forget about you for long periods of time even though they are not busy. The busser ended up take good care of us, though.",209,1204,96
"Starbelly is a great spot for comfy brunch food or for their amazing restaurant week deals! I initially came to Starbelly after I saw that their restaurant week lunch was $15 for a 3 course meal consisting of: chicken liver pate, a fried chicken po boy and a salted caramel pot de creme for dessert. The service and the dishes themselves were absolutely delicious, the best of the three definitely being the chicken liver pate which was buttery, and rich with a hint of sweetness. It paired very well with the jam that was served along side the pate. The fried chicken was quite good as well, but it was not as scrumptious as the chicken liver pate, and there are far better places to try fried chicken sandwiches at (such as World Famous HotBoys in Oakland) which outshine this sandwich. Nonetheless, it was a solid sandwich and was very filling!The dessert was also tasty but nothing exciting and new, simply tasting like caramel custard. The second time I came for Starbelly's brunch which is far more fabulous than the restaurant week courses - albeit pricier. My sister and I got the:- French Toast (4.5/5): The french toast came with two thick slices, coated in a strawberry conserve, mascarpone, and pistachios. Although both toast slices were fried they were not too oily and perfectly balanced. The only thing that was missing was a side of maple syrup to dip the pieces of the toast that were not covered in fruit conserve into. - Mimosas: (5/5): The mimosas here are fabulous with the perfect amount of sweetness in the Orange Juice to contrast the strong champagne.- Chorizo pizza: (4/5): The chorizo pizza was great with eggs, large chorizo chunks, cilantro and fresh tomato sauce, however the crust was a tad doughy and the cheese was not as melted as I prefer on oven roasted pizzas. The eggs, however and the chorizo were delicious elements!Be sure to stop by Starbelly the next time you are in the Castro!",336,1922,129
"My favorite restaurant in SF (to date). They have one of my favorite pasta dishes, star belly spaghetti, that includes jalapeño and thick pieces of bacon. I always have the best time there and it is located off of market so it's super convenient to use public transportation to dine there 10/10 would recommend!",54,311,20
I've been wanting to try this place and I'm glad I did. My appointment was 2 blocks away from this place. I did not regret it. The staff was nice  especially the bartender who helped me. I was seated right away. Monday and I guess this time of the year is busy but at least I did not wait in line. I was alone so I decided to sit at the bar. I order 2 things and a beer for me and it was more than enough. I loved the mussels so much,93,433,39
"Stumbled upon Starbelly since the bar we planned on going to was closed and this was one of the most reviewed places in the area. We came on a Friday night around 8pm without a reservation, but managed to be seated after about 20 minutes (shoutout to the party that didn't show up for their reservation). The back patio was cozy and thankfully enclosed from the elements because a bitch gets cold!Can't speak much to the food since we just wanted to have drinks, but we decided on the crispy Brussels sprouts since we love us some Brussels sprouts. They sounded real good on the menu and our server even gassed them up, but we weren't fans at all and definitely had better at other places. The crisp was mostly on the outside leaves, so it was mostly soft, reminiscent of steamed/boiled Brussels sprouts your mama made you eat as a kid. The balsamic flavor wasn't as intense as I would've liked, but the bacon was a nice touch. The cocktails, however, were good and worth coming back for. I had the Strawberry Alarm Clock (house-infused strawberry vodka, aperol, lemon) and the friend had the Salty Dog (tequila instead of gin, elderflower, fresh grapefruit). I don't do vodka like that, but the strawberry infusion took off the edge and made for a refreshing drink.On the way out, our server asked us how everything was, but we didn't have the heart to tell her that them Brussels sprouts were not it because sis was real proud of them. I'll have to come back and try the other food on the menu, if not for the drinks!",274,1519,125
Consistently good food and friendly service. The patio is great and good vibes inside. A great spot,17,99,3
"Front and back outdoor seating. Make sure to request for back outdoor seating on your reservation.  You can enjoy your company and food without observers. Drinks was very good and delicious. We order loco moco, margarita pizza and burger with fries. Each dish was cook to perfection. Service was amazing and attentive. Every staff had their masks  on and hand sanitizer at front entrance. Street parking and walking distance to Castro. We take quick tour to Hot Cookies after.",79,476,25
"Great neighborhood restaurant to get a bite to eat. Try the pizza try different specialty menus does get kind of crowded make sure make reservations. If not, you can walk in his wish. The tears were a little more comfortable services. Good I would recommend this place to anyone visiting and to change it up a bit.",57,314,20
"Ordered delivery via Caviar and loved the food! All the dishes were on point and exactly what I wanted pear date, blue cheese & endive salad ($12) - fresh, crispy, refreshing Pears and endives balanced with sweetness from the dates and tangy-ness from the cheese. Do wish there was a little more blue cheese thoughButternut squash dumplings ($10) - surprisingly sweet flavor due to the butternut squash! A little disappointed with the portion size though - only came with four dumplings Starbelly bacon pizza ($17) - lots of flavorful arugula and bacon on a thin crust Crispy Brussel sprouts ($9) - huge serving for the price! Crispy texture without being too tough. The flavor really coats every layer of the brussel sprouts which is awesome. Nice smoky bacon",128,760,36
"What a wonderful, cozy place for date night during COVID! Went in on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy (I imagine they must get packed on Friday/Sat night). They have outdoor dining outside of their restaurant but highly recommend you try booking a table on their outdoor back patio - super cute and more sheltered from the wind/cold. Ambience - 5 stars Food - 4 stars. The pasta was light and delicious, the smoked mozz pizza we got was a little too heavy for us. The chicken pate is to die for BUT don't gorge yourself like I did or you'll have some pretty bad stomach cramps lol.Drinks - 4.5 stars. The sangria is meh, but their cocktails are great! Definitely go for those over the sangria.",129,698,50
Starbelly has a nice selection of vegetarian options and a good wine list. I would recommend.,16,93,5
"Came with a large group on a Sunday night. I got reservations here through opentable very easily - there were plenty time and seating options for Sunday night. You're also able to pick whether you want to sit outdoors on their covered patio or inside (standard seating).Our waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole night. We ordered a variety of small plates to share. Favorites were the butternut squash dumplings (the dumpling wrap was so tender and flavorful!) and burrata. We also ordered 3 pizzas to share and they were all great, especially the starbelly bacon - the pie is topped with an overly generous handful of arugula. The crust is a bit crispy for my liking, but others probably would enjoy. Glad I got to try out another restaurant in the area with a very pleasant experience!",140,809,53
"Love that they have vegan cheese for pizzas. Something here for everyone. Amazing salmon entree, great wine and cocktails. Back garden patio has the best ambiance, inside is a bit loud.",31,185,11
"Appetizers and pizzas were really solid. The bangers and mash was undercooked the first time with a significant amount of pink left in the sausage. The second plate they brought had less pink but was still visible. After sending the food back a second time, the manager came out and agreed to comp our appetizers, but was defensive on the coloring of the sausage. Highlighting that it is fully cooked despite the color, and it's made in house. However, a friend who got the same dish as me had no visible pink coloring in theirs.",95,529,43
"Not only is this an Ocean-Friendly restaurant, meaning this establishment has met/exceeded SurfriderSF's criteria for environmental friendliness, but also this place has a great environment and amazing food! My friend and I were quickly seated on a Monday night, sitting on the outside patio surrounded by adorable plants under a fabric roof. We ate the starbelly salad, potato dumplings, and chorizo pizza. Everything came out in a timely fashion and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and seasonal. The portions were the perfect size and left you full without being in a food coma. The waiters were also super friendly and checked in on us periodically without being overwhelming. Would highly recommend checking this place out if you're on the fence!",123,764,50
"11/14/20I just want to start with this, so you don't think this is another one of those f'd up reviews where I'm like... the food's good but I hated my waiter cause he was having a bad day.  NOPE.  This one is 100% the chef.  The food is TERRIBLE.Okay with that out of the way, another thing to note is that I think this might be the strictest restaurant in terms of masks that I've tried yet this #Covid19 #CoronaVirus season.  The irony is that they don't really social distance here, BUT, all the eating spaces are separated by dividers.  Is that enough?--well, I guess that's up to you, but your chair WILL be inches from your neighbors, but with a 3/4ths-height wall or tarp separating you.  To me, I was okay with it, but just FYI.  But again, the mask thing is STRICT.  They even will not put your food down until you've masked up.Okay, so, now for the good stuff...1. Bloody Mary $11 ""vodka, tomato, chile, house-made bacon"":  Alright, I actually liked their bloody mary.  The flavor was strong, and the liquid was modestly thick and smooth.  I could use a tad more alcohol, but it was fine for brunch.  No real heat though unfortunately.  7/102. Starbelly Salad $12 ""with leaf lettuce, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, salt & pepper vinaigrette"":  So, read the description--cause that's EXACTLY what you're getting.  That's correct, $12 for sorta-fresh lettuce, kinda like the stuff you get in those mixed green bags at the supermarket.  Tomatoes.  And... the world's most basic dressing.  TWELVE DOLLA'S.  Absolutely zero effort here.  1.5/103. Sunnyside Joe's $13 ""lost coast ground beef, cheddar, onions & spinach, potatoes"":  So this was interesting--it's kinda like their version of a loco moco (which they also had on the menu)?  There's a hamburger patty underneath the spinach and cheese.  Um, yeah, well, that's what it is--patty, spinach, and cheese.  Egg on top.  OH, and the sunny side-up eggs were overcooked as the yolk was half cooked through, BUT strangely, some of the white was still raw and snotty.  The patty was VERY overcooked, and strangely gamey tasting, though I didn't mind the flavor cause I like that sort of thing.  But the meat itself was quite dry, but luckily there was lots of moisture from the spinach and gooey cheese.  The potatoes were lightly fried, and had a good oven-baked flavor.  Overall it tasted okay, despite the overcooked patty.  5/104. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles $16 ""maple syrup"":  BAD.  One of the WORST chicken & waffles of my life.  Nothing wrong with the waffles themselves, but nothing worth noting either.  BUT, the chicken... wow.  Bricks.  They used white meat, and waaaaaaaaay overcooked them.  Also, the coating was not crisp.  So yeah, mushy coating over bricks.  It should be noted that the white meat was thin, and not even a whole piece of breast, which could have helped with the cooking level if it were.  They must have taken a piece of breast and cut it down 4 times or so to less than 1/2"" thickness.  It's very hard to cook a thin piece of breast to be moist.  So, yeah, it wasn't.  What a crappy way to spend sixteen bucks.  1/105. Cornmeal-Fried Fish Tacos $10 ""house pickled jalapeno & spicy slaw"":  The fish itself tasted fresh, but was overcooked (story of the day) so it was pretty dry.  But worst of all........ there was BARELY any fish at all!  Like seriously.... I get that times are tough, but do we really need to be rationing food like this as if the city was in the middle of a famine???  The tacos were like 80% cabbage.  Seriously.  Just look at my pics--tell me if you can find the fish k?  Oh and the coating wasn't crisp... (you knew I was gonna say that right?)  2/10And lastly, there was a ""SF Mandate"" charge on my bill.  You know how I feel about mystery charges, aka las vegas resort fees.  Work it into your prices like moral businesses would.  Don't surprise people at the end.  How would you like it if you bought a new car for $40k and find that they charged you a $2k worker's health insurance fee?  Wtf right?Just no.1/5#sanfrancisco #americanbrunch #americanfood #star #americancuisine #americanbreakfast",711,4119,257
Nice atmosphere. Food comes out really quick (granted we were here early). Cocktails are solid and overall pricing is fair. Staff was attentive and engaged. I would go back.,29,173,9
"Came here to celebrate our anniversary and though it wasn't the best meal I have had, it didn't disappoint. I liked the food and ambience here.  It's got a modern vibe with sidewalk booths, inside seating, and a back patio area with warm lighting. Online reservation was easy and convenient and we were seated promptly. We got here at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. I noticed plenty of to-go orders during our time here, even saw folks getting to-go drinks.Indoor tables were well spaced out, there was 1 other party in our area. We were asked to keep our masks on when the server approached the table. Service was prompt but wasn't particularly friendly and not on par with other establishments. Hence the 4 stars.We got 2 cocktails  - the Otro Diablo which was on the sweeter side and the margarita mezcal which was more balanced. I enjoyed the mezcal more.For the appetizer, we ordered the butternut squash dumplings and the brussel sprouts. Food portions were on the smaller end but was filling. The dumplings were creamy and refreshing, a great start to dinner.Got the veggie burger and starbelly pizza for mains and both tasted great. Nothing extraordinary about them, just good American food.Would recommend the food here.",209,1225,84
"BEWARE OF DECEPTIVE MENU AND PAYMENT TERMINAL!!Disappointed after reading the glowing reviews here. The food was just OK, nothing crazy special though the vegetarian burger had some fun twists to it. What really upset me is the lack of transparency in their pricing.As we walked in we were handed a menu identical to the one displayed at the door. The prices are listed as $15 for the burger(s) and a 4% healthy sf charge. And yet our final check has the burgers at $16 and a 5% healthy SF charge. That's unacceptable.They use Toast and the machine provides tip suggestions which calculates tip using the post-tax total (so you tip on tax and healthy SF, which is not service). As the healthy sf charge is included in the pre-tax total you basically have to work out the total yourself and then use the custom tip option. It's a very deceptive and shady practice and is different to most other restaurants I've been to.",163,919,67
"So, I'm sitting here seated with my colleagues, and it's been about 20 minutes... no drink have come yet. We haven't ordered cocktails or anything, just soft drinks.  Update: one of the burgers was missing bacon and cheddar, someone ordered a burger, and wasn't offered a side, the fries were not crispy as they could have been and not very salted. I ordered the fried chicken and French toast. It was interesting in the regard that it could have been more flavourful.  The French toast was more eggy than I would like it to be. My supervisor ordered the pizza and said that it wasn't very crispy and that is tasted frozen.",112,623,54
"I've taken so many first dates here. Reliable, charming with good, straightforward food. Even if your date doesn't go well, at least you know the rest of it will be fine.",31,170,12
"Finish other small business meeting and meet friend at this restaurant around the 16th street. This is the celebration of the post covid, and everyone seems to enjoy and have a good time inside. We orders many drinks , the lady prefer the light cocktail, other men just order draft beers and other sparkling drinks or whatever comes to their minds. We also ordered local asparagus pizza, pizza Margherita. I ordered the original starbelly pizzas. We had crispy fried Brussels sprouts and some homemade fries as an appetizer. The atmosphere were excellent and people seemed to enjoy coming here.",99,594,32
"I used to really like Starbelly pre pandemic. However, I think it's gone a bit downhill. I am pretty patient these days as I know places are struggling. However, I had a pretty poor service experience not just once but twice. When I decided to give them a second chance, the service was almost just as poor as the first experience. When we sat outside on our first experience, our waiter was just terrible. We were a table of 5 and everyone thought the server might've been high since he was a bit aloof and forgot everything we asked of him. We had to ask for things several times before they were brought to us. He also never visited our table to see how we were doing after those items arrived or if we wanted to order additional items. And in the end, he left from his shift without telling us or transitioning us to a new server. So we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our check and the waiter had left the premise. We went and explained our poor service experience to the folks at the front and were shrugged off. I even later wrote to the manager about it, instead of sharing it on Yelp, and was shrugged off once again. Feeling it might be a covid related fluke, we decided to give them another try. Again everything was disjointed. We ordered two starters and two mains and everything arrived at once not allowing us to enjoy our starter courses. Our table was also broken but we couldn't move to another one so we pretty much had to hold the table together while we used our knife and fork to cut, hoping the table wouldn't fall apart. Also, the food we ordered wasn't as good as it used to be. Same with the cocktails. I had been a regular at Starbelly. But now the service is definitely lacking, the food not as good anymore, and most importantly they don't seem to care if you have a positive or negative experience. With all the other great restaurants in the neighborhood, I'm taking Starbelly off my list. I want to support folks who care about their customers.",369,1981,165
"This spot is so cute and the food was amazing! I got Eggs Benedict and my friend got fish tacos (good also, very spicy!) 4 stars because both times I have visited Starbelly for brunch I have had the same server and they seemed extremely unenthusiastic and honestly it felt they were annoyed when we asked small questions about the menu such as, ""do you have coffee?"" and really never come back to the table to check in/ask for refills on drinks ... they took our order/gave the check and that was it.",93,500,41
"Within 24 hours, come at whatever time you want, it doesn't matter, there are a lot of people here, and I've often come, seen a lot of people, and left.I'm lucky that I'm here for 10 days and I'll get to try any dish. I made a reservation here on a Sunday evening because it's relatively less crowded than other days and times of the week. The waffles and chicken had a strong enough flavor. There were portions that I thought for a moment that it wasn't cooked well, but it wasn't because the chicken was 95% cooked well.The service is top notch and I should mention that the order comes quickly and you hardly have to wait. You can also order a fresh juice to cool off while you wait.I was told that the main restaurant was more crowded than the terrace and go there, I liked it better",150,787,69
Really good spot in the Castro. Good food and decently priced! Pretty hopping place so reservations are good to make. Service is good as well.,25,142,8
Such great food and our server was very personable! I loved their pasta. Great place to catch up with friends.,20,110,8
"Very unassuming from the outside, but it is so cool inside. The decorations fit the vibe of the place. The food is so good. We ordered the spaghetti, butternut squash dumplings and the fries. All of the food was surprisingly good, same goes for the drinks.",46,256,20
"Definitely make a reservation for the weekend, but if you don't it is worth the wait. I can only speak on the pizzas (bacon & mushroom) but if other items are half as good as the pizzas then I'd love to try them all.",44,216,24
The food was delicious and the service excellent. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly,14,90,6
"Gurl negative, no FLAVOR! Please season the food! The service was okay, the atmosphere was good.",16,96,5
"I would definitely go back to Starbelly. It looked really cute inside especially with their glass wall that you can see through to their covered back patio. I really enjoyed their chicken liver pate, the onion made all the difference. I also enjoyed their duck confit. It was perfectly paired with the pomegranate, and the bread pudding. I would say the mussels was my least favorite of all the ones we had chosen but it was still pretty decent.I really want to come back and try their other seasonal menus.",90,507,34
"Super easy to make a reservation and they have the covid system down. Everyone is pretty far apart and they're running like clock work. I looked at the menu online before heading to the restaurant and had my item picked out but they had a different menu available and my item was not in there. I'm on a strict diet so I only ordered the Brussels sprouts with the sauce on the side and it was not that great but, my friends foods looked great! So service is awesome, restaurant is super clean, I would have to try the food again when I'm not putting myself through a hellish diet.",110,579,52
Food still isn't bad but service definitely went downhill. The staff used to be way way friendly but this last 2x I went back they don't seem to care to come around to check on their customers. I asked for ice water like 5x before they refilled my ice water.,50,258,17
"Super cute, love the patio, food was pretty good, but nothing amazing. Service was wonderful.Stopped in on a Sunday for a very late brunch. Got seated immediately, service was excellent. We originally sat inside, but they saw that I couldn't really hear my partner, and they helpped us move outside to the patio. One thing, there is only one bathroom, so just don't wait till it's urgent to go. The patio was a wonderful space. Super cute with lots of plants a full roll up sunshade. Food was good, not amazing. The French toast was a lot of fun. And we got the something Joe's which was basically a loco moco but instead of rice there were veggies. which honestly was a great idea especially for keto. Overall, cute not too pricey, and a good spot if you're looking for a good brunch with friends. For sure gonna try and come back and try dinner. Thanks, Sophie",157,862,63
"Great food, service, fun atmosphere - this place has it all! Whether it's lunch, brunch or dinner, it's always super good.",21,122,6
"Went to dinner last night.  Shared the pate appetizer - with mustard grain, marmalade jelly and toasty bread.  Delicious.  We shared the margarita pizza with burrata and mushrooms.  Also very good.  Excellent service, good prices, lovely atmosphere.  Went w a friend at 5:30 pm - both of us 65 plus.  When we were there very comfortable for us knowing most places accommodate younger people.  Will be back!",67,406,19
"last time me and my fanily went to star belly it was great and service was amazing, this time around they took a long time to get to our table and even greeted a large party of 15 htat came in after us... not sure what happened there but we will give them another chance after this expirience",58,292,28
I recently visited Starbelly and I must say that the food is really good. I highly recommend this place.,19,104,5
The food was amazing ! That pizza?  Delicious! Great service as well! The space ir really nice as welll!,19,104,3
"Starbelly has been on my to-try brunch list for a while and I finally got the chance last week. My friend was back in town from HK, we grew up together in the city and were in search of a new place to try out. The restaurant is contemporary and casual with communal tables in the main dining area and picnic tables in the outdoor patio, they also have parklet seating out front. We were seated at a high table in the main dining area and were quickly greeted by a staff member. We ordered the Chicken Liver Pate w/Sweet Onion Marmalade - this is THE dish to order. The pate was smooth and decadent and the sweet onion marmalade made for the perfect blend of flavors. I tried the Fried Chicken & French Toast - fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. French Toast was big enough to share, I ended up eating only half of one toast! My friend tried the Chilaquiles with a side salad which was tasty and also equally as huge as my dish. Overall beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, and delicious food - I will be back to try other dishes on the menu soon.",205,1077,81
"I've heard about this place for a while now, but hadn't been able to make it yet. Finally got to go there on New Year's Day. Not only is the vibe definitely positive, but the staff and food are great. I got the chicken and waffles for brunch, and I have to be honest that it was quite amazing. I'm pretty picky about my chicken as well. Definitely will be going back!",72,367,35
"A casual yet elegant cozy setting serving flavorful comfort menu items in the heart of the Castro! Worth a stop! Was here with a small group on a Saturday evening - outdoor and indoor dining options currently available. Seated promptly without a reservation ~7 pm. I ordered the starbelly bacon pizza which was topped with jalapeño, arugula and a green goddess dressing smooth with a hint of tarragon and creamy mayonnaise, sour cream that permeated the wealth of existing aromas. The crust was crisp, toasted with a crunch and not doughy or stuffy, but risen, thin to the center but held its integrity against the enriching blend of tomato sauce and dressing. Bacon bits were finely diced and fried to allow bitesized fulfillment with every mouthful of chewing. The arugula was a great compliment to the fatty but guilty delight of bacon - with fresh greenness and its characteristic almost pungent fragrance immersed well as a component of the whole. Unfortunately, the jalapeno seeds were removed - a little more spice would serve the pizza well!  Had the turmeric tonic - a good blend of lemon essence with a hint of ginger sprightly, punchy and inviting. Would want to come back and try their brunch menu some time!",208,1220,74
"I love the ambiance of the restaurant and our server was really sweet and friendly. He really took cared of us. However, I was a little disappointed with the food. I got the buttermilk fried chicken & waffles and salty dog for drinks, but the food was lacking so much flavor! The chicken could have used a lot more seasoning. The food also came kind of cold which was not great.",71,378,26
"Very limited menu! This place is just a place for brunch and alcohol - we came for weekend lunch and there was not a single vegetarian sandwich option. I saw a veggie burger option online but was told it was not part of the brunch menu. If they offer these options at other times, why not for weekend lunch? The servers seemed genuinely offended that I asked for a vegetarian option and, when I settled on a fish taco, could not offer me a non egg/mayo based sauce or even a simple vegetable or two so it wasn't dry. I ended up with a tortilla and fried fish. I realize they make what they make but simply apologizing and saying they cannot accommodate my request would have been better so we could have gone elsewhere. While the food was unsurprisingly poor due to my own extremely limited options, I am leaving a one star review for only offering meat options for sandwiches and poor service.",165,894,69
Love this spot and the service! The back patio is where it's at! I'm here for both the chicken and waffles or the chicken and French toast. Both fire. Does not disappoint. Also that lavender lemonade is fresh!,38,209,17
Great place with great food! Shared appetizers and espresso martinis. High recommend!!,12,86,2
"I came here on a Sunday for brunch because our first option was closed but this was a decent backup plan.  We walked in without any reservations and managed to get seated immediately for indoor dining.  The outdoor seating in their parklet and private back patio looked full though.I got the Sunnyside Joe's and overall it was fine - nothing special and could use a few improvements.  The ground beef patty was bland but the onions, spinach, and cheese helped add some flavor.  The eggs weren't completely runny and some of the yolk was cooked through.  Kind of a bummer since sunnyside up is pretty much in the name of the dish.  I like cheesy things so it was nice seeing all the melted cheese on top.  It did leave the whole dish a bit oily though and salty on certain bites.  The side of crispy potatoes was a winner though.",151,828,59
"Shocked at how bad our server was and the experience as a whole for this area.  All of the staff was rude and had an attitude.  It was one of those places where the staff all acted like you were an inconvenience to them, like they had something better to do than wait on you.  For these prices I expect better.   Also the CHINTZIEST pours I've ever seen for wine and they are overcharging for their glasses.  Barely a 4 oz pour, I've had bigger pours wine tasting... Will not be coming back here, there are SO many good restaurants in SF and in this area, don't waste your time here.",112,583,52
We just ordered salty pups and are waiting for them. Will update on results. Very hopeful.Edit 1: Has not come yet.,21,115,6
"They accommodated us my wedding party after city hall. It was very good food, price and ambience. Will definitely come back.",21,124,5
"4 humble stars solely for the house made chicken pate appetizer. Honestly, if I could redo the meal, I would've convinced my friends to order two orders of the chicken pate. It comes with a side of a generous dollop of grainy mustard, jam (omg so freaking delicious), and 4 pieces of thick rustic bread, perfectly toasted with charred marks. The waiter was also so nice to give us another order of bread for free!The other items that we ordered were alright, nothing too memorable. But man... that chicken pate is so, so, so mesmerizing. If you can't already guess, I highly recommend ordering 1+ order of the chicken pate : )",112,626,33
"Wonderful service and great food. I arrived before my friend and the hostess was kind enough to seat me anyway, even on a busy Sunday, without a reservation. I was able to enjoy the ambiance and sip a coffee while I waited. My friend had the loco Moco (her go-to) and I had the Sunnyside Joe's. It was delicious. Very flavorful and fresh... and filling. I asked for French fries instead of breakfast potatoes and they kindly obliged. 5 stars for excellent service and excellent food. I'll definitely be back!",90,508,32
Amazing...loved the service and food! Would recommend this restaurant to any guest traveling from out of town!,17,110,8
"Recently ordered takeout from Starbelly during Covid-19 SIP. This is one of my coworkers' favorite restaurant as she introduce it to us, so we have dined here a few times pre-SIP, and celebrated a birthday or two here. Being in Castro, this place has always been really happening and busy. One of our (my friends and I) favorites here is their signature Starbelly spaghetti. Sweet, tomato-y al-dente spaghetti and then a bite into their signature house-made pork belly aka Starbelly...Wow!Sometimes you just want to share something amazing, so I got the spaghetti (Star of the show) so my hubby can try it. He thought it was delicious, too. I also ordered the pizza (yummy) and the fried chicken burger. And a side salad. Because we ordered so much, we shared some with a neighbor and we still had a lot of leftovers. Although we didn't all eat together at the same time, we were all able to try something really delicious together.",162,932,71
Great first date spot. Loved the outdoor area. I ordered the Margherita pizza. I got this drink at the bar that the bartender recommended. It had egg whites and Portuguese hard liquor. No idea what it was called but it was light and airy.  I would definitely return for a dinner with friends or a date night.,57,308,21
"A-MAZING! The food here is always worth the trip from San Jose. I came for the brunch on Saturday. I decide to try the Chorizo and Sunny side eggs pizza. It tasted so fresh. All the ingredients worked well on the pizza. I had never had a pizza with sunny side eggs cooked on top. Now I wonder why I'm just discovering this! I highly recommend it along with the FRIES. They give you a ton of fries - enough to share. The drinks are also excellent, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. I had a lychee martini and a glass of orange juice. Great brunch. Be sure you make reservations. It was packed for brunch with a long waiting list. I was so happy I had made reservations.",127,668,44
"Overall: Great place to have brunch over the weekend. Parking is easy to find - lots of free spaces on the streets.Food: I love their French toast! It's crispy and not too sweet The Loco Moco dish is alright, a bit salty tho. My friend ordered Sunnyside Joe's and said the beef was juicy and tasted good.Service: our server was great. Though he seemed very busy and not always around, it wasn't hard to find him and ask for things.",80,431,31
"Monday, 8/23.  Dinner.It's a bunch of little things that are easy to fix but overall not a great meal. Starbelly would benefit from someone paying more attention to the details and doing quality control.What colored our experience was being surrounded by mosquitoes while sitting inside up against the front window. I left with three bites, my wife with one. If you check the tape you can see her slapping one across the table on my left wrist while we were eating. I've been here since 2010 and didn't even think SF had mosquitoes!- Cocktails (1/5) : Far, far too strong. I'm all for strong pours, but I would like to taste the other ingredients in an expensive cocktail, which neither of us could. Some nights I want to chill with a cocktail, others I want to get shitfaced and forget about the week. When we order the ""Lemongrass Caipirinha"" and ""Lychee Blossom"" we would like to relax a bit :)- Heirloom tomatoes (3/5): This came out so incredibly fast my wife joked it must have been dying on the pass before we ordered. That, plus the small amount of burrata had withered into a sloppy goo on the tomatoes when it was served, which burrata does when torn and left out at room temperature.- House made chicken liver pâté (3.5/5): Pate was good! Bread was so burnt that we smelled it immediately when the board was put down at the table. I like my toast pretty crispy with a crunch, so much so I think others would say it's too dark. This was beyond ""crispy"" or ""charred""; definitely burnt. You know the difference when you smell it, like something fell in the back of the toaster and was vaporized.- House-made potato dumplings (3/5): Fine, but sitting in a pool of butter like they just came out from under a heat lamp? Hard to describe, but would not order again.- Starbelly Bacon Pizza (4/5): Quite good! Sauce and arugula cut through the richness of the bacon; jalapeños added just the right amount of spice. It did need a bit more time in the oven. Some of the bacon pieces were in clumps on the pizza (back to what I said about consistency and quality control). We reheated two slices at home today in olive oil to crisp up the bottom and it was good!Not super inspired to go back.From the moment we walked in the vibe just felt... off? Phoned in? Hard to articulate, but sort of like Starbelly is just going through the motions now. There's a decent enough menu in a decent enough spot but the autopilot is engaged and the pilots are on their phones.- Those mosquitoes were obvious buzzing all around the front of the restaurant; no one cared enough to do anything about it? Why seat us there?- Did our server not think to return the bread when hit with a face full of burnt toast smell when they picked it up? (it was that bad)- Or maybe someone in the kitchen could have decided not to send out the $14 tomatoes with cheese snot?Come on y'all, you can do better than this. Running a restaurant is tough, and a nightmare during/after COVID and I feel for you, but these aren't major things to get right.Let's go Starbelly!",552,3035,234
"This is a great spot in the Castro. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and upbeat, and the service is great!",23,118,11

"Table for 2 Saturday 6:30Dinner of two small plates (liver pate really good), a salad, a pizza, drinks (mezcal cocktails perfect), desserts, all excellent!""Cat"" helped us, she's terrific!!!The restaurant environment was fun & lively, the price was great. Easy parking close by, too.",43,282,9
"Great service and food.  We enjoyed all of the items, the pizzas were quite good and so were the small shared plates",22,116,10
"I kept waiting for my server to apologize to me. It seems that ongoing supply chain issues must've prevented this place from getting its regular delivery of salt. How else to explain how *bland* the burger and the fries were? Seriously, why isn't the chef seasoning the food?",48,275,18
I've been coming to Starbelly for over a decade now and am surprised to realize I never left a review! It's one of my favorite restaurants in SF not only because the food is delicious but also because they have an amazing back patio and the service is always top notch.Went there the other day and my wife had the fried chicken sandwich with fries. I did not try it but she was very happy with it. I had the crab garlic noodle with squid ink noodles and it was delicious! Definitely a place that I will continue to frequent as long as it's around!,105,547,55
Always love coming here! Their service is great because they always take reservations and seat you right away! Their pizzas and mussels are so good but the star of it all is their duck pate! I dream of the pate!!!!Their cocktails are also good but kinda small  they put a lot of ice. I always get doctors orders and I feel a little better about drinking a cocktail! Starbelly is definitely one of my favorite places in the Castro.,79,430,31
"This is definitely my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. If  10 stars was an option in no doubt this restaurant deserves it. The service is always good and so is the food! I don't really have recommendations on food here because everything is phenomenal!!! Definitely miss living 10 minutes away, every time or pass by the city I make sure to stop by and have a nice lunch/dinner here!",69,388,27
Love it and always so many delicious choices!  Love sitting outback on the patio!  Staff is always friendly and welcoming,20,121,7
"Starbelly is sooooo good! Their chicken and waffles were delicious, and their house cut fries with 3 dips were out of this world. Their fries are cooked perfectly and they have just the right amount of salt. The music & ambiance was also very positive and fun. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Starbelly and I already can't wait to go back!!",62,343,24
"Went here for brunch, had a reservation and was seated right away. Specify inside or outside when making the reservation as a tip.Tried the loco moco and presentation was nice, sauce was not what I expected and I didn't prefer it. Tasted okay. Maybe too sweet or something seemed missing.Chicken sandwich was sadly a bit cold and not crispy. Flavor was decent. Overall nice atmosphere; food was good, but not as amazing as hoped for.",75,433,31
"Starbelly has a nice back patio, and a parklet out front for outdoor dining.  The wait staff are friendly and show up at the right times during your meal.Food I've had:Clam Chowder - very tasty.  Not life-changing, but very solid.  Chunky and full of clams and potatoesLamb Metguez - full of flavor.  Delicious lamb sausages.  The bean purree and eggplant combo make this a great dish.The Burger - absolutely excellent.  Cooked perfectly medium, and was very juicy and flavorful.  Added cheese, avocado, and bacon.  Bacon was thick and juicy with just a perfect crunch.  The fries that come with it are a bit lifeless, but not bad.Margherita pizza with salami - nicely done.  It isn't as good as the pies st their sister restaurants, A Mano or Beretta, but still tasty.Overall, everything was as expected.  Waiter was nice, drinks were solid, and food well-prepared.I'll definitely be back.",147,890,54
"Really great brunch spot! Service is great at times, just depends on the server. Chorizo and egg pizza is delicious!",20,116,7
Oh my gosh!!! What a fantastic restaurant. I'm from San Diego and met some friends here who live in the City. It's one of their favorite places and I can see why!! The food and service were extraordinary. I highly recommend it and will be back for sure!!,48,254,20
"Inventive food - good people- great drinks, good wine -  central location Great people watching. What else?!",17,108,0
"In 2020, there's no shortage of Brunch spots in any major city, and SF is no exception. On my latest trip to SF, I happened to stop by Starbelly with a friend as a Brunch part 2 for my Saturday morning. We made a reservation and it was definitely helpful, even for our 1pm reservation, there were a handful of people who were walk-ins and ended up having to wait. The location is easy to get to, and it's right off of Market, so it's a nice walk if you're in the area.Starbelly has a fairly straightforward menu, and doesn't disappoint in its selection. It's standard brunch fare, but good options all around. As this was my 2nd Brunch of the day, I decided to go the dessert route and tried the Challah French Toast. I can wholeheartedly say it was a good experience and a worthwhile option! Starbelly's drinks don't disappoint, and most people will find something that fits their palate. My friend got a coffee, but I personally went for the diet cola, and the local offering is Boylan's. An expensive soda, yes, but worth it in my opinion. Of course, not every restaurant is perfect...Starbelly has two main weaknesses that I saw while being there for brunch. First, even for a non-peak brunch time, the inner ambient volume is excessive if you're trying to have a normal conversation. Not sure if it's the acoustics or just how the restaurant is laid out, but my friend and I found ourselves just shy of yelling to get any communication back and forth. Second, there were a couple of times we were left waiting for staff for 15-20 minutes after we'd asked for something. Definitely not the end of the world, but also a little disappointing for an upscale restaurant during non-peak times. Overall, I'd still say Starbelly is worth a try! It's a good option that's likely to appease most brunch goers, and has a nice vibe and aesthetic.",330,1839,148
"Starbelly has wonderful service, great food, and excellent cocktails  it's a perfect brunch spot!",14,97,4
"Love the atmosphere, food, seating options, service. All 5-stars. This is one of my favorite places. I was super comfortable sitting at the bar until my friend came.",28,165,9
"This place was a last minute choice as my son and I were manning our sales booth for the Slowly Noe Street Art Mart. One never knows about what's open Sundays in the city. I happened to overhear some passerby mentioning StarBelly to someone and found it while Yelping for places open. After looking over the online menu, it not only sounded like a great all around place, but the prices were reasonable as well. I flagged a waiter and he led me inside the lobby to order. The place smelled heavenly - like challah bread!  A few people were seated inside Dara apart. I ordered the StarBelly pizza - complete w their signature bacon, arugula on top and the mozzarella cheese on half of the pizza. Added their ground Chuck burger with a side salad, potato wedges fries w three sauces. I then went outside to wait. Ended up having a LONG chat with a friendly lady with her dog, and saw the waiter coming to me (a business away!) with my order!  So glad I'd tipped him well!!!The pizza - aaaahhhh!  Nice thin crust but with some umph, very tasty sauce and the green goddess dressing atop the arugula-sprinkled pizza!  According to my son the cheese part was, ""mmmmm!""  The salad with it was big enough for a meal itself!  The goat cheese made it so even a lactose intolerant person could eat it. The dressing light and on target without an overpowering or greasy feeling. The fries were generously good though I felt the sauces (ketchup, orange and green - unknown flavors, look up on menu) weren't all that exciting and somewhat bland. Even a kick of salt or spice on one might have helped them. And now we reach the burger!  It's a Dagwood Bumstead sized burger!!!  On a sesame seeded challah round bun, lots of lettuce, red onions, I added a side of bacon (2) slices, and tomato!  Wow!  Best deal on the menu!!!Definitely going back to StarBelly!",333,1844,113
i saw 2 bugs in my fries and a piece of hair.. very disgusting,14,62,7
"Consistently underwhelmed by my experience here but it's a good last minute reservation and the outdoor patio is an excellent option for outdoor dining during covid times.I've tried their dumplings (too cheesy for my tastes), the margherita pizza and mushroom pizza (pizza dough is just not very good - doesn't have the airiness and flavor I wanted - and the margherita pizza ended up soggy), and the starbelly salad (pretty basic salad).",72,438,30
"I went to 3 places for SF Restaurant Week, and out of the 3, this was my favorite. 1. PRICE - at lunch, it was a 3 course meal for $15.15. What?! This exists in San Francisco??2. QUALITY - Not only was it very affordable, but the quality of food was impressive. Chicken liver pate with sweet onion marmalade, grain mustard, and butterbread, fried chicken po'boy, and salted caramel pot de creme, with a cornmeal rosemary cookie. The chicken liver pate is already amazing in itself, but when you combine it with sweet onion marmalade and mustard and spread it on butterbread, wow what a burst of flavor. Very rich appetizer. Then comes the savory fried chicken po'boy, solid burger. And top off the meal not just any cookie, but a cornmeal rosemary cookie complementing a salted caramel pot de creme. I believe this was one of my most memorable lunches for the start of 2020. 3. AMBIANCE - OUTDOOR PATIO IS SO FREAKIN CUTE 4. SERVICE - great, refilled waters, brought food in a reasonable time, didn't feel rushed. 5. LOCATION - great location in Castro. I'm happy I discovered this place during SFRW, and I'd definitely come back, especially for the chicken liver pate and salted caramel pot de creme dessert!",213,1209,69
"I live 2 blocks away and have eaten here many times. They do some things consistently well and other things not so well. I like their burger, their pasta with bacon, and their pizzas. I've gone for lunch twice, first time I got the chicken and waffle and chicken was over cooked. Today, I came here on a lunch date and ordered the chicken po'boy based on server's recommendation and the chicken was inedible. It tasted like it was a cheap frozen piece of chicken they'd dethawed multiple times. Very hard to chew and unpleasant. I wanted to send it back but it was a first date and didn't want to come off bad. So I instead took the chicken out of the sandwich and just ate the bread with the condiments and I guess that could also make me look like a pushover on the date, so also bad. I've had other bad experiences here but also good ones. I like this restaurant but it's really inconsistent. So if I ever do come back, I'll stick to the burger or pasta and not venture out again. And I'll definitely stay away from any chicken dishes they have bc the chicken was so bad. Ambiance and decor is nice though.",210,1109,85
"My friend and I decided to go to this place on Saturday night in the last minute, so we didn't have reservations, and we waited for like 30mins in the back patio. We were not super hungry, so we ordered few small bites. The most impressive one was def the squash dumplings. It had roasted nuts and the squash was really smooth! The lamb meatballs were also very tasty too. I like the lamb flavor, this one has the flavor but it's not too strong to cover other spices smell, it was perfect blended. The chorizo pizza was perfectly moisture and all the toppings were proportional too, which made every bites equally amazing! The sweet potato soup was kinda out of our expectations, it was good for sure, but we were expecting more like pumpkin soup kind of sweet soup. Overall, we had a good time in this restaurant and will for sure revisit!",154,840,68
"This is such a cute and fun place!  I'd definitely come back with friends for cocktails.I had one of their pizzas, it had squash, feta, black garlic, sage, and pumpkin seeds. I really liked the combo of flavors, but it could've used a sauce or  something so it wasn't just loose things on crust.  Overall, good food in a really hopping environment!",62,348,25
They have a heated patio in the back as well as curbside dining which makes it a great place to eat during the pandemic.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and the food/service are consistently good. It's very popular so reservations are recommended.,45,257,23
"The service is great, the atmosphere is nice.  I had the pulled chicken sandwich and didn't really like it- the mayo was overwhelming.  (wouldn't recommend it) I plan on returning to try something else.. Soon...  Okay, I've been back a couple times and I get the chicken poor boy (or something like that)..it comes with slaw and fries.  It's actually quite good.  The prices are reasonable, food is good, it's in the hood...perfect. I like this place and recommend it.",80,468,24
"I absolutely loved this restaurant. Thank you yelp for sending us here!They had a really nice booths built outside that were over and above what I imagine the Covid regulations are. I also love that they had a little note on the table saying that you need to wear your mask anytime one of the staff members were at your table for everyones safety. It was huge for me and the experience I had, that the restaurant cared enough about its employees to do what they could to ensure their safety.So, the food. We were here in summer so I had the privilege of eating their corn pizza which is to date, the best pizza I have ever had. I wasn't sure what to expect but it had everything that you want in a Pizza and more. It was fresh, cheesy, flavorful, hot, literally everything. Accompanied with one of their delicious cocktails that I overindulged on, it was my favorite Meal in San Francisco that weekend we were visiting. My boyfriend was also obsessed with his food (shame on me for not remembering what he ordered). We left here so happy. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was also a delight. I would love to come back here when this restaurant is operating under normal circumstances because the ambience inside seemed so quaint and cute when I went to the restroom I most likely could stay there all day if given the option. We will definitely be back in the future, that's a guarantee.",258,1406,119
Tasty comfort food and excellent cocktails in a open environment. Reservations recommended and parking can be a challenge.,18,122,7
"Living in the area had wondered about this spot as it's usually crowded around brunch, so popped in for Memorial Day and no wait, so we gave it a try. Sorely disappointed and won't return.The principle reason is our server was negligent and never returned to see if we needed anything even basic like condiments for our eggs. Meanwhile, he spent considerable time chatting with other customers while not once checking in on us. Probably because those he was chatting with were white and, therefore, deserved better attention and service.  Additionally, the food was mediocre and lukewarm at best.That's the problem with some Castro area eating spots: cute boys with abysmal customer service standards and food that's just ok.",119,725,52
"great food, great service, amazing outdoor patio. my go to lunch spot.",12,70,2
Great food and drinks and the service was terrific. Our waiter was very nice and quick. We particularly enjoyed the Starbelly bacon and mission fig pizzas. Definitely will be back.,30,180,11
It was just okay - nothing special. Mediocre food and drink and atmosphere with San Franciso prices.,17,100,5
"Deeeeeeeelicious!I loved everything I ordered from Starbelly and hope to one day eat their great food in the actual restaurant. My order was placed in lieu of a Thanksgiving meal last year and it was such a great decision. The broccoli and Brussels sprouts were cooked to perfection, the butternut squash dumplings were outstanding, and the Starbelly bacon? Well, you might want to grab two orders. I could easily recommend anything on the menu and you know what? I think I will! It's all delicious!",85,499,29
Outstanding food and service. Cool atmosphere. Dogs are welcome in the back area. Always a plus.,16,96,5
"Great place for a casual evening, date, or out of town guest dinner! Love the Salty Dog cocktail.",18,97,6
"I'm a fan of Starbelly's brunch.My significant other planned a date-day and asked if I could come here early to get a spot. It was around 10:30 am, after a recently rainy period. Having sat in the front portion of the restaurant, I asked if we could sit in the back patio area. The 30-35 minute wait turned into only a 10 minute wait, and the host asked if I wanted to close out my bar tab and get seated right away. ""We would need to ask you to leave by 12:45 for the reservation."" She asked nicely.Absolutely. That's quite some time.Once my significant other arrived, we shared a Loco Moco, a Pizza, and a french toast. Everything, as I remembered, was very tasty. The portions were decently sized for the individual, and among the two of us, we finished everything.The server kept coming back to refill my water and it was a great experience.I would say that this place is fantastic if you catch it on a good day without a wait. Typically there's at least a 30 min-1 hour wait, depending on the weekend, which makes this place great but harder to justify.",195,1058,77
"Straight to the point, order anything with the pork belly and you will be blown into the space. It is DEEEEEEEEEEELICIOUSSSSSSSSS. It is best piece of pork belly that i've tasted EVER.I got a spaghetti with pork belly upon the server's recommendation and I was so glad that I did because it was the best dish I had while staying in San Francisco. The only two disappointing things were1) it took me good 8 minutes to be greeted and sat at a table.2) was told that I could only dine in if I can finish and leave in 45 minutes. I was a party of 1 so I wasn't too opposed by it but let's be real. I was a little offended. It also seemed a little rough to make this happen as the food itself took 27 minutes to come out, for a spaghetti. I had less than 20 minutes to finish it. But i still give 5 star because the server was nice and kind and helpful. It was the host that told me to hurry up and leave so shame on you.",185,916,84
Came by for happy hour on a Monday and the place was pretty quiet. A few patrons at the bar and a family in the patio. We got a seat at the patio and instantly regretted not bringing our dog when we saw one begging is owner for fries. Got some drinks which were really good. My patio punch would be a summer hit. Love the hint of lavender.  Forgot the name of my husband's drink but it had turmeric. We also got a small order of the chicken pate. Just enough so we weren't drinking on an empty stomach. Wonderful place. Would love to come back and try more.,110,557,47
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, and I go to work in the City once a week so I thought I would reconnect with a friend after work to grab dinner together. I have personally been on a health kick and was worried that their healthy options would be lackluster, but oh my goodness their salads are amazing! Drinks were amazing. My friend got a pizza and she said she enjoyed it (it's pretty big!)",80,413,36
"I have been coming to Starbelly for a couple of years and consider it a staple in the community. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the food quality is still good, the service cheerful and the drinks decent. The menu is a little static although many menu items are favorites like the butternut squash dumplings and bean purée. I've never been a fan of the Starbelly Salad but the other dishes are decent.",71,400,30
"Overall a very solid place, with a few misses: Good ambience, good food, good drinks (with 1 exception), good service (with 1 exception). Reservations through OpenTable are convenient and straightfoward. COVID precautions: I appreciate that they take COVID seriously with their mask rules, generous spacing between tables, and QR menus. They require you to put your mask back on before a server will take your order or bring your food/drinks to the table. AMBIENCE and layout: Spacious, well ventilated back patio with warm lighting and lots of heat lamps to keep everything warm. Tables are well separated from each other, and they even have tables big enough to accomodate groups of 6 (their max currently). FOOD: Mostly modern American small eats at reasonable-for-SF-bar prices. They have sandwiches ($10 chicken po'boy looked nice, but I didn't try it), brussels sprouts and bacon, mussels, beans, etc. I had 2 fish tacos that were quite good but maybe a biiit expensive. The rest of my group got the brussels sprouts (amazing - sweet, tangy, savory) and a corn bacon pizza (I didn't try but they said it was amazing). DRINKS: Anywhere from $10-13ish for a cocktail, $9-15 for a glass of wine. There are some interesting cocktails using whiskey, tequila, mezcal, and spice. The drinks I tried were all a bit on the sweeter side. My first drink was the Otro Diablo, which is a juicy, sweet-tangy tequila mix - solid. [MISS #1] My second drink was the Salty Dog. A traditional Salty Dog is just a Greyhound (vodka or gin, with grapefruit juice) with a salt rim. Starbelly's version is gin and grapefruit, with some - too much - elderflower in there. Way too much elderflower, and the grapefruit juice isn't strong/fresh enough. The drink comes off sickly sweet and bitter without enough acid to brighten it - when I took my first sip, I said to my group ""it tastes like bathroom cleaner smells"" and they agreed it was uncanny. SERVICE: Service is fast but not particularly warm or friendly (echoing other reviews that said the same) and it's pretty easy to find someone to place more orders with. The servers gave us plenty of advance notice of the 9:15 last call and 9:45 ""time to go home"" deadlines. [MISS #2] Our main server, a taller lankier guy with curly medium length black/dark brown hair gave us off vibes the entire night. He wasn't straight up mean or discourteous, maybe impatient. There was a clear feeling he didn't want to be serving us that night. Noted.",425,2473,140
"Great service and I like the food.... Been here twice in the last month for lunch.  Servers were very sweet and friendly.  Most of the space is Covid safe and comfortable.   Flat bread was tasty(seasonal corn- yum),  burger very good, salads very nice.  The alcohol drinks are addictive and I'm looking forward to returning.",55,324,19
"Always great and casual but not too casual to bring a nice date here. Slightly dry meatballs, but menu changes frequently and they have great desserts ! Friendly staff !",30,169,10
"I came here for a friend's birthday. We had reservations for a party of six but they crammed us into a small table meant to seat four. We asked if they could push the small table next to ours to create a larger table but they weren't able to do so. I ordered the french toast which was my favorite thing off the menu and it was surprisingly filling. The pistachios gave it a nice crunch and I love the pairing of marscapone cheese. The other dishes my friends ordered looked visually appealing but didn't really wow them. Nice ambiance and the lighting was really nice during the day out in the patio seating. But I did notice that it was really loud because the patio seemed to amplify all the voices talking in the room so it was sometimes hard hearing what the person across from me was saying. In terms of spacing, I think this restaurant is more suited for smaller parties during the brunch time rush. Would be nice ambiance for a date but depends on how much you want to have conversation. Perhaps dinner time would be different?",192,1035,86
Great food in a charming spot. I do wish the menu was a little more expansive but what they offer they do well.,23,111,12
"Bring a sweater here. The staff is icy cold.I don't understand the coldness and the feeling that the staff is disgusted by their patrons.We ordered two things because literally the minute we sat down, we wanted to leave. We ordered their liver mousse, as everyone said it was so great. It arrived without any of the accompaniments. After we finally got our server to make eye contact, we asked if there was supposed to be some mustard and other items and he said, oh yeah.The chicken sandwich was ok. I would've given one star but the liver mousse was very good after we got the whole dish and we also appreciated the selection of sauces he brought out with our fries.Some warmth and friendliness would go a long way from all the staff.",133,736,59
Service is stellar. Cocktails are excellent. And food brings me back regularly. Love this place.,15,96,4
"Starbelly's restaurant week menu for lunch is such a steal! Getting a great 3-course meal for $15 in San Francisco is something that is pretty hard to find, but Starbelly executes it very well! After going to Restaurant Week places for a couple years in SF, San Jose, and Oakland, I have to say that Starbelly was one of the most worth for the price. The inside of the restaurant was very nice and cozy, with the colored stars in the patio area adding a nice touch. The service was good and I have no complaints there. Now onto the food:1st Course: We got the house made chicken liver pâté, which was a dish that I haven't had since I went to France over 3 years ago. This dish was delicious, and the liver pâté was very buttery and creamy. It definitely paired really well with the mustard and jam that was offered with it on the bread.2nd Course: For this course, we both got the fried chicken po'boy which was a good amount of food. This came with a jalapeno and radicchio slaw that added some flavor to the sandwich. Although the fried chicken wasn't amazing, it was still pretty good and definitely was filling.3rd Course: Now for dessert! The salted caramel pot de crème was delicious, and I greatly enjoyed it. It was honestly one of the best caramel dishes I've had so far, and wasn't overly sweet or salty in its flavor. Definitely would get again!Overall the meal was great, and for $15 during restaurant week it is absolutely is one of the best deals I've seen around the city! I definitely will be coming back here again and recommend it highly for anyone!",287,1568,119
"Always fantastic !! Food , service , drinks are great !! The seasons and mock tails ( for Dry Jan) are also great",23,113,4
"This was my first time going to Starbelly for dinner and, overall, it was not an enjoyable meal. The food was poorly prepared and executed, and service was inattentive. To start with service, after we sat down our server came to the table at the start saying ""I'm here for anything you need"" but then very quickly left without offering water or checking if we had any questions. We laughed about it with a couple sitting next to us because it was so contradictory, but the inattentiveness was consistent throughout the duration of our meal. As for food, to start, the water jug we received tasted really strange, like they had filled part of it with sparkling and part of it with still. For appetizers, we got the goat cheese dumplings and grilled octopus. The dumplings were fine but the octopus was undercooked and the overall flavors of the dish were completely off. For our main dish, we ordered the roasted corn pizza but were served the margherita pizza instead. While we were able to return the pizza for the one we ordered, at that point, I was already disappointed in the dinner experience as a whole. I'll give their brunch a try next time but won't be returning for dinner anytime soon.",213,1197,98
Great food and ambiance. The location is perfect and the staff were helpful.  We had a great experience!,18,104,7
"I want to like this restaurant and have tried it many times as it has one of the nicest outdoor dining patios in the area and very nice staff.  I have found the food to be okay, if not extremely inspired.  After my last visit I don't think I will be back the mediocre food is not worth it. I am not sure if they have a new chef? The Fritto misto was made with corn meal and very hard.  The French fries were good, but the sauces underwhelming.  The meatballs were the most overcooked and dried out things I have ever eaten and the kale salad was terrible.  The pizza margarita was the best thing we tried, but even that will not make it worth revisiting.",127,654,57
"Great back patio but not the best ventilation if that matters to you. Good selection of drinks, food was good. All around pretty normal nice experience.",26,152,8
"I came here with a friend recently, due to his suggestion. I guess when you grab food and drinks with a queer couple, the Castro is a must. =) Not complaining at all!Thankfully, they wanted to share foods so I got a variety of tastes. My friend upsold the pate, insisting we had to get it and that it was delicious. I was worried, because when people gush about something it often leads to failure. This. DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The pate is soooo BOMB. Get it. We had a mix of stuff so the quick and dirty.Persimmon salad: Fresh, properly dressed, and delicious.Brussels: A little oily but flavorful and crispy. Pizza: Just solid. Not special, but if you want a pizza here it'll do.Steak: Nicely cooked, nicely seasoned. Somehow a giant order of fries appeared at our table too. And the sauces were delicious. Utterly delicious. What brings it to a 4 rather than a 5 for me. The service was good overall, their manager got his hands dirty and helped serve our table as well.  But they were very clear that we had to leave by 8 because of a reservation. We didn't mind...but then they sat a table of 2 next to us at the communal table and those guys said they were not a reservation of more. So...why did they hurry us out? It felt really weird. Don't take it as a total negative though. I'm sure if I made a reservation and came here again, everything would feel and taste 100% how amazing restaurants are and should be. This place is awesome and you should definitely try.",271,1469,111
"Been coming to this place for years. Was my go-to place for takeout at the start of the pandemic. Highly recommend the Dr.'s Orders cocktail. Food is consistently good, and it's one of the few places in the area open for later dinners.",43,235,19
"I like this place. The food is always tasty and the atmosphere is fun.  Staff is friendly and they keep things moving pretty fast, never too long of a wait. Sometimes it's pretty crowded but that's understandable because it's a good place so it makes sense it's popular.",48,270,19
Got the French toast and it was pretty good. My friend actually picked this up and brought it all the way to hayward and it was still warm!,28,139,14
"I was with my godson and his parents celebrating the upcoming Christmas Holiday. He and I both had the most delicious chicken, waffles with maple syrup that we've ever enjoyed. The chicken was crispy and not greasy, fried to perfection. The waffles were light, fluffy and oh so yummy with warm maple syrup. I am looking forward to my return visit. I should try something else, but will probably have the chicken and waffles again because they were that good.",80,458,35
"The setting is lovely for a Covid meal. They have retractable awnings and heat lamps. Not freezing through a meal was awesome. They welcomed us to a table at 4:30 with notice that there were 5 reservations. When I made reservations it said nothing about a 30 minute window. They fortunately didn't boots us out. We did not ask about dessert. The foods was 2/3 enchanting. Corn soup, delicious. Fried chicken po' boy light crispy and delicious with a mild jalapeño slaw. The problem was the salad. The vinegar over powered any flavor. I'm sure they will adjust making their salads delicious. Both the side salad and entree salad had the same issue.",113,647,38
"Came here around 10:30am on a Sunday. It wasn't super busy- but since we didn't make a reservation we could only sit outside or at the bar. We chose outside since they said they turned on the heaters, but I still thought it was cold. We shared the Sunnyside Joe's ($13)- which was ground beer, cheddar, spinach, and potatoes. I absolutely LOVED the potatoes. They were so crispy and delicious- I wish there were a few more. The eggs were definitely way over cooked- there was no drippy yolk and the beef didn't have a ton of flavor, but with the cheese it tasted better.We also got the Challah French Toast ($14)- It came with mascarpone, peaches, and pistachios. This was soooo good, I loved the combination! While it was a bit dry around the edges, the middle was quite yummy and not overly sweet. Presentation was also beautiful. It nicely complemented the savoriness of the other dish. I didn't think it was going to be enough food for the two of us, but after we were finished, we were definitely comfortably full. The service was a bit slow and it took a bit longer to get our food (I think they forgot about us outside!).",206,1128,88
Always a reliable place for solid food and nice staff that make you feel comfortable and appreciated,17,100,6
Excellent food. Best burger in the Castro. Pizzas are great too. Fun ambiance and cocktails. Reservations are recommended although they do have a communal table by the bar that is sometimes available at short notice.,35,216,14
"I really enjoyed my meal here. My friend who lives in SF picked it up on her way to visit so I had to warm up by the time she got here, which was to be expected (I now really appreciate eating food in-person so much more). I went w/the french toast and fried chicken combo. I hadn't had either in such a long time, so decided to go w/that as my entree. I was not let down--really buttery french toast (I should have asked for more syrup, you only get a small container on the side) and crispy on the outside/juicy on the inside fried chicken. Decent sized portion for a takeout item too. I would definitely like to try the other dishes and cocktails whenever I can actually make it into this establishment.",135,706,57
"This was my second time at Starbelly. I don't really remember my first time (it was a larger dinner party), so this review is based off my recent experience. We came here on a Saturday at around 3PM. There was 6 of us, and we loved everything about our meal. We ordered drinks, and we all loved our drinks! Our server even gave my girl a tequila shot (we were brunching after wedding dress shopping).As for the meal, every thing was excellent! We had:Brussel sprouts- 5/5 this was sooo good. Crispy and sweet. We didn't realize it had bacon, so my vegetarian friend couldn't eat this. But for a meat eater, these brussels were perfect! Elote pizza- 4.5/5 I loved this! We ordered 3 pizzas, and only ate 2. They are massive, I would definitely share this among 2-3 people. Loved the sweet corn, and the sauce on top was sooo good. Tasted like some kind of aioliFries-5/5 these tasted like those double fried fries they have in Belgium. Soooo crispy and the sauces were good. I think it was pesto aioli, house made ketchup, and chipotle sauce. All of them were good, but I loved the pesto! Butternut squash ravioli- 5/5 this was my favorite thing I had! It was cooked in brown butter & fried sage. Sooooo flavorful. The raviolis themselves almost tasted like dumplings. I loved the textureChicken pate- 3.5/5 this was my first time having pate. I don't know what good pate is, but I wasn't the hugest fan. I did like the grilled bread tho, it was blackened and delicious. They're doing a good job with covid, social distancing and m, and ask that when the servers come you put on your mask!",288,1588,105
"Visited on Saturday night and wasn't seated right away - no problem. Didn't see anyone at the table for a while - but busy - no problem.  When they took our order we were specific we didn't want everything to come out all at once.  It came out literally backwards - drinks came out last and we hadn't eaten the appetizer before the pizza was there and it did not taste great cold - WTF?!  No one came by to check on us until we were done, and when I asked for a togo box they wanted me to jam 2/3 of a pizza in a small to-go box.  The food has slipped and the severe is crap.  We won't be back again soon.",124,605,59
"A decent experience for dinner. Everything we tried, whether the little gems, the chorizo pizza, or the fried chicken, was OK enough, although not necessarily mind-blowing. Just OK. The fried chicken, in particular, was a tad too fried.Perhaps the strongest point was the service; the staff were generally attentive, courteous, and professional. The venue itself is also larger than it appears at first glance thanks to a nice outdoor patio in the rear with a sturdy-enough tarp to hold up well even on a particularly rainy and windy day recently. Not a bad choice overall.",95,573,35
"I was really excited to come back to Starbelly, but was disappointed during this most recent visit. I think the food was 3.5 stars but with the lackluster service I'm giving it 3 stars. Hoping it was just an off night for them. The charbroiled mussels looked visually spectacular but the mussels were not fresh at all, to the point where they weren't pleasant to eat and we left the plate unfinished. It's probably the only time in my life I didn't finish a plate of mussels as appetizers.The Grilled Bavette steak was rubbery. It's a cut of flank steak so I was expecting it to be tougher, but not to this extent. It was also flavorless, which I wasn't expecting. The vegetables with this dish lacked any flavor. Chicken Liver Pate saved the day, and as other reviews have indicated, simply incredible. Great flavor and just delicious with the marmalade and mustard over bread.Starbelly bacon pizza. Pretty solid. Bacon was really good. The tomato sauce is excellent.",168,968,73
I had the recommended chicken sandwich. It was delicious. Friends let me try their pizza. Everything was an absolute delight. Drinks were good too. Would recommend to anyone.,28,174,9
"Oh Starbelly;  how my belly wasn't full, nor did I think this was a 4 star experience.Started off with the fresh and super bitter orange juice. Skip it.Pizza was so bland, and had so little cheese I thought maybe they thought we were lactose intolerant. I mean, a Margarita pizza is supposed to have cheesy goodness--not bland crust and dry sauce.The mushroom pizza was only slightly better,  only because it had mushrooms, but once again it was lacking cheese and sauce.The next meal was catfish which was so ""blackened"" no one ate it. Dry and burnt, but sure, call it blackened if you want.The steak was chewy, and the desserts were plain. The butterscotch pudding also had a weird flavor to it so no one took another bite and the Chocolate cake was dry and cold.For our Christmas work dinner,  this place was a disappointment.",145,829,65
"Great little place in the Castro with indoor and outdoor dining. Good variety of food and wonderful, friendly service. Outdoor seating has heaters and indoors has tables and bars with a back and front patio. The cocktails are fun, but very sweet. Had the Otro Diablo tonight but have tried their marg and the salty dog. Corn pizza is really tasty as is their cornbread! Would recommend for food and drink night out, but don't go if you're expecting to have just good cocktails.",84,477,35
"Friendly staff, they have outdoor seating in the front and back. Baby friendly (I recommend the back). The pate and mussels are amazing!",23,136,8
"Nice back patio! It was shaded and had pretty plants. And because it was fully surrounded, there was no wind. I don't know about you, but since the pandemic one of my main criteria for selecting a restaurant is the quality of the outdoor seating.Great menu. I really enjoyed my Mediterranean platter. Be sure to make a reservation; this place is popular.",62,354,26
"The fries are delicious, salty and crispy, but the best part is the toffee cake! It was so soft and the caramel was so rich.",25,124,12
"Was a little disappointed for a few reasons but one in particular. We booked reservations for restaurant week and while other restaurants seem to honor the menus weekday and weekend, this place didn't (which isn't a bad thing), but it also didn't note it on the restaurant week site and we booked our reservations through there. What was supposed to be a really good deal for lunch $15 ended up being way more for way less since we had try things off the regular brunch menu. We were told when we got there and apparently a few others around us ran into the same issue. Anyway,Ordered:-chilaquiles which was tasty however there were so many jalapeños (not spicy) but I didn't order a jalapeño chilaquiles and that seemed to be the primary ingredient after the chips. -chicken sandwich that was on restaurant week menu but $10 on its own.  The chicken was a bit dry to be honest and really thin. One side/edge of it was completely crunch batter without much chicken -the mushroom pizza we substituted white sauce with red and was asked if we wanted arugula. We shouldn't have made the assumption but it sounded like it was included but they charge $2 for it. Overall pizza was okay. Mushrooms were good and gruyere cheese added a nice kick but the pizza was soggy I couldn't lift it up form the crust side without all the toppings sliding off. Restaurant ambiance is nice and cute though with indoor, outdoor, and communal tables.",253,1429,112
"(3.5 stars) Perfect spot for dinner with some friends. The back patio is wonderfully cozy with heat lamps, plenty of space, and peaceful decor. The food is very solid aside from the French fries which were disappointingly thin and unseasoned, though the sauces were a unique twist--with the green one being the standout. Loved the broccolini and the white bean dip, both great for sharing. Struggled to choose a main but landed on the chorizo and egg pizza. I normally love a runny egg on anything, but it actually was a bit overwhelming here since each egg landed on its own slice. The chorizo had some kick to it though and went really nicely on its own with the cheese and thick crust.",123,688,53
"Great cocktails, Mexican Coke if you feel like a soft drink at lunch. Wonderful, competent, friendly service.Ordered a hamburger with cheddar and fries. Delicious! Best fries ever . At first I thought that $23.00 (plus tip) was a bit pricey, but it was so generous that I got lunch and dinner out of it. Fries were even good cold. So glad they're in my 'hood.",65,359,21
"Came here for sf restaurant week (late review yes i know), and it definitely gave me a reason to come back. My friend and I made reservations on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch - place wasn't packed but definitely wasn't anywhere close to empty either. There's an indoor and outdoor seating area in the back, and I'd highly recommend outdoor if the weather is nice.We ordered the chicken liver pate to start, mediterranean plate and fried chicken sandwich for entrees, and a creme-brulee like dessert. The pate was my favorite part of the meal, honestly I'd go back just for that. Definitely get it if it's on the menu when you go! The smaller version is available during happy hour, and the larger version is available during dinner.pro-tip: u:dessert story is a close walk away if you're craving something sweet afterwards",141,822,53
"Starbelly has been doing restaurant week for awhile now but is only doing M-F for spring 2022.  We came on a weekend brunch around 1pm on Saturday the place was packed but not full.  We ordered Italian Eggs and Sunnyside Joes per the server's recommendation.  Both dishes were great, not huge portion but the food filled me up.  Because it is comfort food, the food is a little more on the oily and saltier side than the normal yogurt and salads.  The price is good for the location and what you get, I would definitely recommend this place.",98,541,43
"This place used to be good many moons ago, but sadly it's slipped way down. Starbelly was sort of hanging on even before Covid where the food was just OK and the service was underwhelming. One would think after being forced to close and revamp after a pandemic that a business would came back as a shooting star and grateful to be making money again. Nope! Still mediocre food and horrendous service that's not fit for roadside diner. Doesn't seem that these ""too cool for school"" kids will get it together any time soon. Time for a change or ownership.**always get a good laugh when the establishment responds with a wannabe witty response for all to see. How about offering to make it up to the paying customers that spend their good money that pays YOUR bills Adam T? Same customers that take the time to write a post and oh gee, I don't know, offer to send them a gift card or refund? TBH why would I ever want to return to have a bunch of smug losers ""make it up"" to me? If you were such a great joint, it wouldn't have happened in the first place. It's called business 101. Perhaps an enema of the staff would be a start. And agreed Adam T. I've had some stellar service at roadside diners and some pretty bottom of the barrel terrible service too and what I experienced at Starbelly was worse than any of those.",247,1318,104
I love the pizza here and the sauce and bacon were tasty. Also draft beer was nice. Very crowded,19,96,7
Food is good. Service is amazing. Outdoor seating is really cute! Bathroom is clean lol.,15,88,4
"Very disappointed w the service. Came w w group for my fiancé's birthday. Drinks always came after food, for 2 rounds, and worst part: told waitress about the birthday occasion and she said they can put a birthday candle on a desert. And She forgot. Desert Came. She later came and Said: ""Oops"". Surprise?! Bad enough you forgot the candle but who are you to come and tell the surprise? And totally talked like you didn't give a shit.  You just messed up the surprise. Maybe at least try to make it right? Come w another dessert w a candle? Or comp the cheap dessert?Foods always not that great for SF, very average.",113,616,40
"Came here this previous Sunday for brunch. We (my cousin, his girlfriend, and I) were going to check out The Mint that day for the free historical day slash the free day at the Asian Art Museum.. so before that..So he made a reservation for 2pm for us and my boyfriend. And requested for the patio outside.The patio is gorgeous and has an open top, but gets enclosed when it rains which there was a chance that it would, but it was still bright and cheery out there. The food was great. And I would highly recommend my dish:chilaquiles, house made chorizo, corn chips, chile sauce, cilantro cilantro, guacamole & house salad ^ only complaint is there wasn't enough chorizo bits at all. Otherwise flavors and textures were all great.",130,732,52
"Went to Starbelly because I was in the Castro for Lesbians Who Tech Summit. I must say...This place was definitely the spot to have a nice meal for lunch during a full day of keynotes and break out sessions. I didn't take a picture of the food but I had the French toast & fried chicken dish, and literally everything else my coworkers had; like the Starbelly salad and the loco moco looked delicious too!! Ill definitely be back. They take reservations as well. Highly recommend checking it out if you're in the Castro and want o eat somewhere that will leave you satisfied full. I was able to meet Stacey Abrams as she too was having lunch at Starbelly. If Stacey Abram and I both approve, it's totally worth checking out !",133,725,54
"Another weekend brunch restaurant checked! Starbelly is located near 16th St. Station BART/Castro so just know that parking in this area is not the best. Starbelly gets pretty packed on weekends so I would recommend making a reservation on Opentable. I made a 10AM reservation for 2 people a week in advance from when I wanted to go and I had no issues.  The place itself is super cute with nice wooden interior and a back patio area with heat lamps to keep you warm even when it's pouring outside. I got the sunnyside joes ($12) and the dish was tasty! The dish comes with some beef on the bottom mixed in with some onions, spinach, and cheddar cheese with two eggs nicely baked on top. It was a nice savory option without making me feel too guilty about what I was eating. The potatoes they had on the side were seasoned well and had a nice crisp to offset the egg portion of the dish. The only con I felt with the dish was that it got a little too runny/watery.If you want something refreshing on the side to pair with your dish the ginger/lemon soda and lavender lemonade are divine!",202,1087,83
"When Starbelly opened its doors years ago in the Castro, people flocked here for their luscious pizza flavors and the fries with trio of dips.I definitely slacked off my yelper duties and never been here until recently for my birthday brunch. We wanted something casual and won't break the bank. We ordered several pizzas, entrees, drinks and even got charged for the cake we brought in, and each person from our group of 8 (minus me!) only spent $42 with tip. Whoa,  brunch is the way to go! From eggciting egg dishes, fresh salads, pizza, sandwiches and a few essential sides you can't live without, the brunch offerings satisfied the group. I had a delicious gazpacho style tomato soup and Italian eggs cooked in cast iron skillet with zucchini and peppers served with thick rustic bread. My friends got the chicken and waffles (so good!), challah French toast (sweet breakfast treat), Prather Ranch Burger (hefty!) and chilaquiles with House made chorizo. We ordered several pizzas and even if you get the very basic pizza margherita ($12) and add toppings like we did, you still will be in the $17-$18 range. (Screw Zero Zero where our pizza cost $25 for mediocre toppings!) the most interesting flavor combination was the roasted corn, white cheddar, Aleppo chili pizza with lime aioli, it was easily the crowd favorite! The wild mushroom pizza with pickled onions was also good. The pizza crusts are soft and pliable, although thicker than a Neapolitan style one.There were some miscommunication when the staff sliced our cake (we didn't want the whole cake sliced, but rather small portions) but they were apologetic for the mistake. Our servers were reliable and took great care of the group. As I get ""wiser"" (older? Lol) I tend to shy away from the super big, boisterous birthday parties. Starbelly let me celebrate another year of life with fabulous food and drinks in a neighborhood atmosphere and I couldn't have asked for more.",328,1942,111
"I'm at the stage of life where catching up with a few old college friends involves finding a place that can seat nine adults and six infants / toddlers - not an easy feat in SF.  My sister made the great recommendation of Starbelly.  It really lives up to its website's description as a ""casual and friendly neighborhood restaurant"".  I was easily able to make a large group reservation on the crowd-friendly covered patio.  The California comfort food cuisine made it easy to share plates, the wine and beer selection is good, and the cocktails are creative.  The bright, warm decor is as welcoming as the service.  The narrower interior would be great for smaller parties that want to avoid the chatter of the patio, but I found the noise level to be perfect: enough background noise to mask when the kids fussed but not loud enough to make conversation hard.",151,861,57
The pizza was awesome. Delicious sparkling rose too! Menu had lots I'd like to try. Will return!,17,96,3
"Really quaint little gem on 16th just off Market St and about 5 mins walk from the Castro muni.Nice hip interior, including an outside enclosed patio and a long bar with counter space to eat. A long communal table with tall chairs, kinda heavy to move but doable.  Booked this table to enjoy the 3 course lunch offered for the SF dining week, turns out it was not offered on weekends, too bad.  However, we still had a good lunch.  The chicken waffle was really good, nice crisp and flavorful $16, the loco moco $11 was simple and tasty, perfect for someone with a small appetite.  Fries with dips $7 are always good, kinda reminded of the fires in In and Out burgers. Most likely will return to try out other items on the menu.",135,728,49
"Starbelly is a cute American restaurant in Castro. I went for brunch, and the restaurant itself is cute and spins on classics. The oyster pizza (discontinued??) was not very oyster focused, more of a cheese flavor with some oyster. A good pizza, but not what I expected at all. The drink was really good and the strawberry really came through without being too sweet. I liked this place for a cute casual lunch, but not amazing.",76,428,33
"I've gone to this place a couple times for drinks and for brunch. The cocktails are very good but the place closes a bit early so not really a bar. At brunch, my group got the yogurt with fruit, french toast, and butternut squash pizza. All were good, especially the yogurt!",51,274,20
"Food is great, love the decor.I have been to Starbelly a handful of times, but last 2 times it was an unwelcome experience. Did not want to write a review after the 1st time, but it feels like a pattern now. Back in November, I reserved a table for 2 for my friend's birthday. We only learned about time limit once we came to the restaurant, but did not have much of a problem with an hour and a half dining. Our order was taken in a timely manner, but food took around 30 min and not the whole order arrived. The waiter forgot about our drinks, and we only got them when we had 20 min left. When he brought the drinks, we asked if we get more fries. He said it is too late, and just brought us a check. The whole experience felt so rushed and we felt uncomfortable. Today, I reserved a table for 4 for my family. We were seated at the patio, and the whole area was very empty, only one more table had people. We were set right in the spot were it was extremely windy. The wind was blowing away the warmth from the closest heater. We were asked if we could be set in any of the 4 tables by the wall or in the parklet. I am still not 100% why we could not have been moved to a different table, the waiter said those tables are ""on tab two"" (whatever that means). So we just left without ordering. The food is great, but I'm definitely not coming back.",269,1350,126
"Next time I'm craving great pizza in The Castro, I know where to go. Starbelly is close to all the action, yet it provides a nice escape from the hustle and bustle outside with yummy food and drinks.We both did pizza. Mine was a Margherita with burrata. The burrata felt so delicate, yet delivered so much creamy goodness. I also enjoyed the perfectly baked crust and the lovely tomato sauce on top. (My dad did a bacon and arugula pizza, and he was also very happy with his pie.)Starbelly also has a great drink list. He found a beer he was happy with, and I found a Neilson Santa Barbara Chardonnay that helped make my day. The service was a bit slow at times, but always friendly and attentive (when someone did make it to our table). I'd be very happy to return soon to try more of the menu!",150,795,59
Best Restaurant in the Castro! Salty Dog is to die for-- and who has pate? Just the right amount of scenery and lively ambience.,24,128,10
"Family went here for my bday. I got steak, others got regular burgers or chorizo pizza. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and there were no leftovers! The waitress was lovely. The person clearing the empty plates was a little aggressive and hovering, but I'm sure that's her job to keep things moving. Overall it was a great meal!",58,332,20
I had a wonderful experience at Starbelly and it was only for takeout! What brought me here was the chicken pate which had a wonderful smooth texture and bright irony flavor that you only get with organ meat. The cookies that come with the pot de cremes dessert were not an afterthought as can easily occur. I was treated to a cucumber and mint lemonade as I waited for my order to go. I plan to return to enjoy the back patio.,82,427,39
"Great food, service and ambiance. Have been walking past this place for years, so glad I decided to give it a try.  Met a friend for lunch and couldn't have been more pleased.",33,175,15
"Had a great dinner at Starbelly. The staff was very accommodating and friendly.The restaurant noise levels are good for a city location, and the place is very nicely designed.The food was great. We tried couple for heir pizzas and they were a great addition to the pasta with red sauce and bacon. The bacon was so good that it made us want more.We also ordered the burrata, which was good. Had a sweet sauce on it. However, it was smeared on two slices of toast, which made it expensive for what they offered. In addition, the consistency of the burrata was missed.The fries were a good finger food as we waited for the food.  The squash salad was good, grilled and placed on Kale. Very good dressing We also tried the squash wontons, very very delicious. So I would highly recommend a visit.",143,792,57
"The fried chicken po boy had poor meat to bun ratio. The whole thing was pretty dry. The burger was really burnt and desert dry. It came with wilted lettuce and tomato, none of which could save the burger. The only reason I gave this place 3 stars was because of the summer corn pizza which was excellent.",58,305,18
"My coworkers have always recommended this place for that after work special. And mama, I finally made it! Three of us ordered new cocktail happy hour drinks to start and then poured over the menu for: chicken liver mousse, mussels with chorizo chili, fries, chorizo pizza, and a white bean purée. Delicious, delicious. Two (three) things kept me from giving this restaurant five stars and sadly, they're mostly easily fixable:- mousse to bread ratio; the bread was great but too bad only two slices came for a mousse that could serve four. - drinks were WEAKKK- the dough on that pizza tho! My friend says it was amazing but then again she's never been to NYC :P Starbelly's was thin crusted but with a hard-to-chew factor that's hard to ignore. I think I'll need to try another slice to be sure...Completely over-ordered for our first time, but that's how you should eat here anyway heh.",155,888,54
"Check out my food diary on Instagram @brittbrulee for more photosI stumbled upon this place with a friend of mine searching for an afternoon drink. This place has plenty of patio and back seat dining, everything felt self and plexi glass between other diners. The service was impeccable. Our waiter checked in on us frequently and was able to get our palomas perfectly made even though it was not on the drink menu. I decided to go for the Mediterranean plate, I could tell right away the produce was fresh and after doing some research I actually found out that they rotate their menu because they focus on using locally sourced ingredients. This was a huge plus for me. Would recommend to anyone searching for a yummy entree or just a place to get an afternoon drink.",137,769,56
"i'm so sorry but i'm literally not a fan of this place. i'm honestly really surprised by all the good reviews. the food is extremely less than mediocre and flavorless. nothing special at all. the vibe of the place is really cute when you walk in but woo, i would not be comfortable spending money here again. i came with a friend and we got fries, liver pate, burrata, butternut squash dumplings, and the lamb meatballs. the best thing were the fries.. which like.. i'm not gonna go to a restaurant to get $7 fries yaknow? the other 2 non-ketchup dips were so strange... just not great. the butternut squash dumplings were the next best.. still wouldn't say i liked them tho. there wasn't a ton of flavor but i did like the touch of the pumpkin seeds and the sauce. the liver pate, burrata and lamb meatballs were... really terrible. there was no flavor whatsoever and the seasoning on the lamb meatballs were strange. the meatballs were borderline burnt and the sauce was NOT good. thought the drinks were going to be its saving grace. but woo no. i'm the least pickiest about drinks but sorry, i can't recommend. my friend got the doctor's order and he said it was ok.. the turmeric was very overpowering. i got the salty dog, but it felt watered down and not a ton of flavor. so. yeah. sorry won't be back.",239,1309,110
"I came here for brunch after hearing a lot about this place. All of their Covid protocols are on point, and I liked the seating in the back patio compared to the front parklet. I appreciate that portions here are enough to feel satisfied but not massive that you feel ill. You can eat well, indulge, but not break eating healthy too.  I had the fried chicken and waffles and I felt that it was good. Not too salty, just right, and the buttermilk waffle complemented well. I look forward to coming back to taste more of the menu.",99,528,43
"Great ambiance, pretty good service, hostess a little rude, I was just here yesterday for a Sunday brunch get together. I ordered a Starbelly bacon pizza nothing that amazing didn't even have much flavor surprisingly, and tried the fries with trio of dips, couldn't even tell what the flavors were of the dip? A green one? And a pink colored one? Just tasted like Mayo, bland, and I also ordered a Caesar salad also bland, and there were old pieces of brown lettuce in my salad which made it taste a little bitter and not fresh and that was also bland, and my friend ordered fried chicken dish which was also bland,  and my other friend ordered chilaquiles and she was also disappointed as well, why is the salad taking up the whole dish? Is it a salad dish or a chilaquiles dish? if there's not going to be salt and pepper on the table, season the food please, this was my first time here and I don't think I will ever come back. This is just based on the brunch menu on the weekends. The food looks better than the taste unfortunately. The only thing I enjoyed was the "" lychee blossom"" cocktail.",204,1098,83
"Great service, food is consistently good - just one of my favorite neighborhood go tos!",15,87,4
"Fantastic establishment-- inviting atmosphere, lively clientele and staff, and delicious food and drinks! Def a place with solid Neapolitan pizza.My bf and I came in on a busy Friday night at around 8:40 and had to wait for about 30 minutes. It wasn't too bad and we were able to get a drink at the bar.Margherita pizza (added arugula): very good Neapolitan style pizza! I came here wanting to try one of their pizzas since I looove Neapolitan pizza. Crust is crunchy, yet chewy and the center is so thin. The sauce is on point. (5/5)Mussels with ground chorizo, cilantro, and toasted bread: soooo good! We loved this. So flavorful, and such a generous portion. We didn't expect this ""small plate"" to be that big of a portion. Definitely worth it. (5/5)We also got the burger cooked medium. It was also really good and the fries reminded me of In-n-Out fries! It didn't stand out as much as the other two dishes we ordered though. (4.5/5)I'll definitely be back! I heard they have fantastic brunch, so I plan to come back here for brunch in the future.",187,1052,70
So - had a reservation on a quiet Tuesday night.  Seated quickly - order taken quickly - then things went south.  My server never came back to the table.  We had to get up three times to get things missing.  Food was meh - drinks were disappointing.  The only reason it didn't get a lower review is I've had a decent meal here in the past.  But rough night,69,356,23
"We had a party of 18 and the service, food, and cocktails were phenomenal! The ambiance on the back patio was very charming and it was definitely warm enough. Highly recommend Starbelly!",32,186,14
"I think Starbelly is a good option if you are looking for a solid sit-down option in the Castro with plenty of seating. The food ranges from decent to good, but I never find the menu very exciting. After a recent meal there, the best thing I had was the margherita pizza we shared. The veggie burger I had was not great and didn't come with anything else on the side.I usually don't care about service very much, but I can't help but mention that I'm not a fan of dealing with multiple service people. Starbelly is one of the few places where I notice this the most.During my last meal there, one person introduced themselves and took our order. Person #2 brought out our drinks. Person #3 brought out the dishes. Person #1 came back to check on us, but was never around until the check. Then, a 4th person collected our finished plates and glasses. When we needed more napkins and wanted to order another drink, Person #2 & #3 took those orders respectively. I don't know. I just don't get it.Also, when I asked for an entree recommendation, Person #1 suggested the most expensive item on the menu by far. Slightly suss. Even more so when I asked if I could order a cocktail, Person #1 said, ""Of course, we have a full bar."" Right, so then how come I couldn't get a cocktail with soda water in it? I think this review is coming off more harsh than I intended. Starbelly is fine.",257,1379,101
"I hate writing a 1 star review when I know restaurants are struggling.  However, a friend asked me where I'd like to go to lunch for my birthday and I said ""Starbelly's"".   I'd eaten there before and knew they had a patio out back which seemed like a perfect choice to eat outside and not freeze. Things started off OK with water being served promptly and our waiter telling us he'd be back to take our order.  We waited, saw two other people be seated next to us and get their order taken before us.  We gave our order to the waiter, two burgers with fries, one well done and the other medium well with cheese.  Our drinks came out and we waited for our meal.  The men next to us received their food before ours which made sense since they got their order in before ours although I did see a pizza delivered, sit there for a couple of minutes, and was taken away like it been misdelivered. Our burgers come out.  Mine is pink and looks good.  My friends is medium rare.  He sends it back.  I start eating so my food won't get cold.  Time passes.  We flag down the waiter who apologizes, but says it takes time to cook the burger to well done.  Yep!  We assumed the cooks knew that too. Waiting a bit longer, my friend cancels his order.  The waiter says we won't be charged, but my friend still declines.  Later the manager comes out and attempts to make amends, saying I won't charge you for the burger and will comp one of the drinks.  I'm thinking, you'll comp the burger that was refused already?  My friend tells me that he arrived about 10 minutes early and the same manager refused to let him 1) have a drink at the bar while he waited for me; 2) then asked him to wait outside even though no one was at the bar.  The manager said he could sit at the bar when I arrived and the party was complete.  Huh?  So, what had been a lunch I was looking forward to celebrate my birthday with a friend ended up leaving a sour taste so to speak.  Now I know, don't go to Starbelly's for special occasions.",383,2002,157
"Starbelly has been one of my go to comfort restaurants since I moved to this city. The menu is always fresh and new but the atmosphere and service always makes it feel like home. You can never go wrong here for a delicious dinner with friends, family, but especially great for a date. It's a must go!",57,300,22
I came here for dinner and drinks with some friends. The cocktails were all delicious and perfectly balanced. I ordered the Margherita Pizza and it was delicious as well! It was also the perfect size for splitting if you're not too hungry. The service was good and the restaurant has a great vibe and the music selection was top notch. I would come back!,64,354,28
"I just wanted to shout out the hostess and servers at Starbelly for making our engagement celebration last night so special and memorable. They brought us both out a glass of bubbly, and when we explained to them that we don't drink, they my fiancee a Mexican coke and myself a BEAUTIFUL prickly pear Shirley Temple (the color of which must be appreciated, see photo). We ordered the chicken pate, cornbread, grilled peaches and the sweet corn pizza and there wasn't a lesser dish out of the bunch. All the servers were adhering to Covid precautions exceptionally well, and I was PROUD to show them my proof of vaccination when we entered. We will be back! thank you! love you starbelly!",121,687,55
"Had dinner here last night and wish I could give it a high rating but finding myself not able to. We didn't have reservations and was told it would be about 25 minute wait. A lot of open tables. Noticed people being seated over and over again. About 30 minutes waiting, hostess came over seeming rushed/overwhelmed and was like I can sit you guys here (a table open the entire time). Once seated we waited 15 minutes to be greeted, only after having to ask for service from the hostess. Waiter drops off water crafts, but no glasses. Another 10 minutes and so random person brings over our drinks. The waiter comes over to take our order. We order an appetizer and dinner. About 30 minutes later, our food is delivered. Because we never got the appraiser we tell the food runner that we don't want it anymore, but we would like refills on our drink. Never getting those refills and we are trying to finish our meal, we decide to speak to the manager to see about getting some level of service. The manager comes to the table to speak about what we need, the server starts arguing with us about what he didn't provide. We tell him that we just want simple service like refilling our drinks and delivering the appetizer, which he yells you canceled the appetizer. At this point we are done. Never have I been to a restaurant that a server yells at clients and argues about not doing their job. Food is 5 stars, but the service absolutely sucks. I use to be a restaurant manager and if one of my servers argued in front of me with a customer that server would have been unemployed this morning.",294,1591,133
"This review is purely for dinner delivery. And, may I say, the food is delicious! Or at least the spaghetti and the warm toffee cake is. The fresh spaghetti with tomato sauce is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes right now. It's simple yet satisfying. And with the Starbelly bacon, it's definitely worth a try. And for dessert, the warm toffee cake hits the spot. Add a dollop of mascarpone and slivered dates and it makes for spoons full of delight. I do hope that one of these days I'll get to enjoy their meals inside Starbelly. But until then, there is so much more to try and get delivered.",111,601,39
"Went on a whim before the Delta Variant Resurgence. Sat at the communal table. Food was fantastic, wait staff was super cute and attentive, wine list was superb, felt like the world was returning to normal. A very fun night out -- Starbelly has great energy!",46,258,16
"Starbelly is always a good bet for brunch or lunch in the Castro. The outdoor patio is great for groups of six and allows you to enjoy a rare nice day in SF.Pizza reigns king in Starbelly but honestly nothing is bad here. Since COVID, they have built out their seating in front of their restaurant even more.Typically end up sharing a pizza, with some arugula on top. The food is nothing to write home about but typically gets it done. I actually really like the cocktails and ambiance (of the back patio) more than anything else.",97,530,39
"I don't even know where to begin.I had to write this review as soon as I got to my destination after leaving the Starbelly.If the name comes from the idea that you're eating stars here that fill your belly, then take me to heaven!!!I came here with a friend as the first spot for SF Restaurant Week and i'm SOOOOO GLAD I DID.It's a cute spot that's great for a date. It's cute, bright, they have covered outdoor seating. hanging lamps, looks pretty typical hipster (they still exist right?) but CUTE and on the fancier side.The music caught our attention though, as it didn't really match the decor, but it kept us laughing the entire time.Starters:Starbelly saladLiver pateEntree:Fried chicken po'boyDessert:Salted Caramel and cornmeal rosemary cookieI didn't get the salad, but my friend said it was good when I asked. It looked very fresh in terms of quality, but the liver pate was the star.It was absolutely fabulous!The baguette was toasted perfectly, with a crunch but not TOO hard where it beats up the roof of your mouth.I'm not a huge fan of mustard, but the pate, marmalade, and mustard was the perfect balance of flavors.I almost forced a piece down my friend's throat it was so good, but I controlled myself to only offered 4 times. (They just aren't a pate person in general.)This definitely set the stage for the po'boy which did not disappoint.They didn't overly season the chicken (though my friend mentioned he could taste the pepper for sure, i didn't get the same).It's got almost a japanese-style breading on it which gives it a different texture than your typical fried chicken but we both enjoyed.they didn't put too much mayo sauce or radicchio, I finished the entire thing after finishing all the pate. The flavors aren't overwhelming and blended well together.It also held together well after cutting it in half which allowed me to devour the entire thing happily.The dessert was the only thing that I won't RAVE about, but it was still good. The creme over the cookie, but the cookie wasn't bad either! It's a thin.... sugar cookie?But it didn't take away from my overall dining experience here.The staff was also amazing. They were prompt at every step, watched when we were ready for the next course, took away our plates in a timely manner.We did have a funny moment when the appetizers were brought over and the waiter/food runner? automatically put the pate in front of my friend (a guy) and the salad in front of me and we had to laugh at the assumption.We left the restaurant BOTH saying that we'd like to return for sure already.Even if it was to have the exact same meal again before restaurant week ends in 5 days.",461,2651,206
"Review based on Outdoor Dining, Aug-8, 2020. (Summer menu)Booked reservation for 6pm, arrived 10min early and they were accommodating and allowed us to seat early.Servers were on the ball and did a good job of being present without beings overbearing.Our food order was: Squash Dumplings, Fries, Spaghetti (no bacon), Burger, Chicken Sandwich.The squash dumplings were absolutely delicious. 10/10 would get that again.The chicken sandwich was sooooo good as well. I wish i ordered two of those The fries and Spaghetti were good too. Nothing bad to say about that.The failing was the burger. The patty itself tasted on the bland side and an overall let down as i LOVE and am addicted to burgers.  I also asked for a salad for the side but got fries instead. For alcohol my girl got a strawberry vodka something that she adored. I received a white wine sangria, but i felt the ice watered it down, thus taking away from the flavor which was a shame and a let down. They used small ice cubes so it melts faster. I then asked for a beer recommendation to go with my burger and chicken sandwich. My server suggested a Saison which was really good. I was happy with that.Our overall experience at Starbellly was a positive one.It has a lovely date atmosphere and overall good food. Again, while I'm normally a burger man that chicken sandwich was super delicious and next time I'm going to get two of those.",245,1401,87
"We had a waiter and I don't remember his name but he had a ""Glutes abs muscles"" shirt ( it was 5 words but I don't remember ) ...Anyway he is a real sweetheart and remembered all our orders and I accidentally bumped my head on his butt while laughing at a joke, but he knew it happens all the time with clients, and I felt at home almost instantly because he didn't make me feel embarrassed like I was doing it on purpose and it was like a family reunion on top of my real family reunion. Get 3 of  the margarita verdes and the spaghetti with bacon. I mean, it's like the El Niño in San Francisco with all this rain but starbelly is like a warm island of good vibes and great drinks. Will be coming back soon for our family reunion drinks and shits.. Xoxo",149,755,69
"I had passed by here several times and thought their front setup was nice and safe. I wasn't aware there was a back area when I made reservations. Personally was not a fan of the back area as outdoor dining. Food was good. Had the chicken and waffles and loco moco. Sangria and margarita were ok.  Would probably have been 4 stars if I was seated at the front , which had 2 empty tables when I arrived for reservation. Just my personal preference and feeling of safety.",88,469,37
I keep forgetting this place and I don't know why. I was just reminded of because of SF restaurant week where I can confirm it is THE BEST deal in San Francisco for lunch (legit but also the food is delicious and the service is really friendly so check it out)!,51,261,22
"My friend and I came to Starbelly for their SF Restaurant Week special: 3 courses for $15!! That's a steal anywhere in San Francisco. We both picked the same dishes: chicken liver pate, fried chicken poboy, and salted caramel pot de creme. The chicken liver pate was a generous portion size--I didn't even have enough bread to finish it all! I loved the sweet onion marmalade that came with it because it added a sweetness to an otherwise salty spread. The fried chicken poboy came out next. I loved the combo of hot, crunchy chicken, soft bread, and the slaw! I expected it to be spicy because there were so many jalapeños in it, but it wasn't spicy at all. That could be kind of misleading, but luckily I don't eat jalapeños much haha. The salted caramel pot de creme was the perfect ending to our meal. It came with a cornmeal-rosemary cookie. The creme wasn't too sweet and I liked the salt flecks on top. This is probably one of the better and affordable SF Restaurant Week lunch menus--try it if you have the chance!",186,1022,67
"Went here for the happy hour on Sunday. It wasn't even busy but service was really slow. The place was really nice.Ordered the pizza margherita, small house-made chicken liver pâté, fried chicken wings. Food was okay, not for the price and service tho, I recommend getting the chicken wings, sweet, spicy and tangy yummm.",54,321,16
"Came here for dinner with a friend before dessert at the newly opened U Dessert Story a block down. We came on a Monday evening around 7:30 and got seated immediately.Neither of us were super hungry, so we decided to split an appetizer and pizza. The calamari escabeche ($11) sounded intriguing, so we started with that and then moved onto their chorizo and egg pizza ($16).I wasn't sure what to expect from the calamari, but I was hoping it'd at least be a hot dish. Unfortunately it wasn't, so it fell flat for me because of that and because it was slightly spicy. I have absolutely zero spice tolerance so it would have been nice to know before ordering. Would probably have ordered something different had I known.I loved the pizza though! It comes with two very runny eggs cooked sunny side up. It was honestly a little hard to grab the slices due to the yolk, but it was worth it as the half cooked egg just melted it my mouth. There was a generous amount of chorizo that paired well with the tomato sauce and the thin crust.Some of their pasta looked really good as well. Going to try that out if I come back!",207,1116,90
Great food!  The Starbelly salad was excellent.  If they added a piece of chicken it would be a great light meal!,21,113,7
"To start, I made a reservation and had to ask the staff inside to see my server after being seated for 20 minutes with only water from the supporting staff. When my not-server approached the table he promptly said the server would be on at a certain time, which is unusual to seat an unopened section at a not busy restaurant. (Our reservation was for 4:30). As my server finally approached, she was distinctly condescending and out right rude at points. She was prompt about not putting food on our table or actually serving us, she never actually introduced herself (the red head on staff I've seen for a while now). Not only did she make a mistake on our order, as she placed the check she was gruff toward check splitting or multiple cards. I have been to starbelly several times and NEVER had service as unprofessional as tonight. The serving staff was absolutely absurd in their action and I hope to not encounter anything like this again. As always the food was yummy.",175,975,77
"This place is fun with a group of friends.  Came here on Saturday night and ordered way too much food.  We (four of us) shared the white purée with flatbread (4/5), cheese plate (3/5), beet salad (5/5), chicken liver patee (4/5), goat cheese dumpling (4/5) and bacon pizza (5/5).  I got the grilled bavette steak with parsnip purée (4/5) and ate some of the fries that my friends couldn't finish (5/5).  Food wise, it's a solid 4 and I highly recommend that bacon pizza. The ambiance is nice but it gets very loud and very busy here. The food came out really fast but the service got a little spotty when it got busy.  Our one main complaint was that the seats were really uncomfortable. It's a good value though - the above meal plus some wine is around $70 per person, including tax and tip.  I would definitely eat here again.",152,829,48
"Great burger! Nice mushroom pizza.Service was a bit slow and weird. Nice outdoor patio. Not a full bar but they have good beer, wine and some interesting saki drinks.",29,166,9
"I'm so sad! My fiancé and I came with reservation to try out dishes. We had sent an inquiry for our after wedding brunch and planned to have a small gathering here with friends. We were sat quickly which was awesome! Our server brought us first round of drinks and some fries/sides to start, never came back to the table for refill or order of main dishes. I do not think we were rude or anything, not sure what happened. We left with dishes to try in mind still and hungry stomachs! I'm surprised. I hope we didn't upset our server in some way and hopefully his day gets better if he is having a bad one.",117,605,51
"The vibe was pretty cool, the outdoor seating was nice. The food concepts were very good. I ordered the Chorizo and Egg Pizza. The concept of the pizza was cool but the pizza was not good at all. I also ordered their burger. The fries were pretty good but the burger itself wasn't cooked well. I had a stomach bug for days after eating this. Food wasn't made that well.",70,369,27
"One of my fave brunch spots in the city. Good food, good music, good service! Easy to make a reservation so you're not waiting around forever. The chilaquiles and loco moco are to die for here... will forever be coming back for more.",43,233,16
"Star belly was very cognizant of mask wearing for all its staff and patrons. We felt very comfortable the entire time we were there. Our waitress was not the most friendly and attentive but overall a good experience. In regards to the food, the brussels sprouts were very good. Also loved their lemonade. The mussels left a little to be desired, but the chorizo was a good add. I wish they had some gluten free option for their pizzas or just generally for many items on their menu. I felt limited as a gluten free diner and our waitress did little to point out options for me but maybe one day they will add. I would go back but wouldn't be my first choice.",124,658,57
"A friend of mine had his birthday dinner at Starbelly a while back. A group of us ended up going on Thursday, March 23rd after 7pm.*house cut fries & three dips ($7)*cheese plate, artisan selection & seasonal accompaniments ($16 for three)*starbelly salumi, mortadella, Spanish chorizo & sopressata ($16 for three)*split pea fritters, curried yogurt ($6)*house-made chicken liver pâté, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustard ($12)*delta asparagus soup, clam escabeche. micro celery ($9)*pan roasted black mussels, Mexican chorizo, market chili & cilantro ($14)*house-made chorizo, sunny eggs & cilantro ($16)*market mushroom, cave aged gruyere, thyme & roasted onion ($17)*pizza margherita, fresh mozzarella & basil, sub burrata ($17)*grilled bavette steak, salt crusted potatoes, grilled cebollita & mojo verde ($25)I honestly didn't try much of the food except the liver pate which I adored. I love pate, so this definitely hit the spot! Nice and creamy. I recall the fries being pretty good as well. Crispy and the dips had a good assortment of flavor. I basically love any charcuterie or cheese board, so these were great! We also had a round of cocktails and sangria. I didn't try any of the cocktails, but the sangria was just okay. Service was excellent. Everyone was nice and attentive.A fun place to celebrate a birthday.",211,1345,51
"I came here today for a late Saturday brunch around 2pm and didn't have to wait at all to get a table for 5. If you come during peak brunch hours, I can easily see the wait being upwards of an hour. I ordered the fried chicken po-boy ($10) along with a michelada ($6) for my meal. The fried chicken po-boy was very well constructed. I often order fried chicken sandwiches when I visit restaurants and one issue I frequently encounter is the sandwich is too dry. The fried chicken itself can be juicy, but without enough slaw and dressing, the sandwich can be pretty tough to eat. The po-boy at Starbelly doesn't have this issue at all. I liked that the sandwich had generous amounts of sliced jalapeño inside, but I wish they would've left more of the seeds in so the sandwich would have more of a kick.Overall, pretty good brunch experience. Food was a little on the slow side coming out of the kitchen, so be sure to order a drink to kill time while you wait.",180,961,76
"I've been dining at Starbelly for over 5 years and every time I go to SF. it's always consistent and good. The menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other San Francisco restaurants. With that said, I suggest ordering the Loco Moco. It's a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy, yet comfortable. The pizzas at Starbelly are fantastic as well. If you are going for brunch, I suggest the Chorizo and sunny egg. It makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch. Their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced. Nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food!",126,717,47
"Located on 16the and Noe which is a difficult area to find parking in general. Only street parking available. Luckily there wasn't a long wait. Brunch was disappointing so maybe I have to come back to taste their dinner menu. The best thing we ate out of everything we ordered was the Starbelly pizza. The batter used on the fish for their fish tacos was dense almost like a hard biscuit. The chilaquiles was mediocre given that it was the traditional dish. One of the chicken po' boys seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way through. The fries was decent and the salad was a good alternative side. Their michelada was orange which was different. Their shandy (beer and lemonade) was refreshing. The sangira was overly sweet, tasted like fruit juice. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch; however, I've heard their dinner menu is better. We left disappointed.",153,878,56
"This place is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not even going to say race specifically. Honestly. Literally almost an hour. We sat waiting and the two tables  around us seated after US, mind you..  were taken care of. Absolutely ridiculous. The seating is extremely close and there is no way on Gods Green EARTH; we can be overlooked back to back for just about an hour. After I flagged the waiter myself and asked to order THEN was I helped.  If you're hungry and flavored. Go across the street. Omm. Ikfaftmfcs. After an hour. Just got some wine... ridiculous. I wish zero stars was a thing. At least some accommodations or an honest acknowledgment of the wait",115,656,39
"Starbelly is an excellent option for date night! My husband had just flew back in from NYC; so we decided to meet here for dinner.I arrived at the restaurant first where I was greeted by the host who was very friendly! She immediately sat me at our table and let me know someone would be with me shortly.I was soon greeted by the server who poured me some water in my glass and asked if I would like to order a beverage. I decided on the Pimm's Cup which was really great and refreshing.I ordered two appetizers the French fries and the margarita pizza with two eggs. Both appetizers arrived just as my husband was sitting down. We both loved the two options; they were full of flavor and delicious! The waitress then came over and ask to take our main course order. I had the veggie burger and my husband had the butternut squash dumplings, and the starbelly salad... we were both raving about how amazing the food was.Starbelly is an excellent option for anyone who is vegetarian and I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in SF! I will definitely be coming back to try something new:)Thanks for a great date night!",208,1138,96
"Huge s/o to my friends Vanessa & Rey for taking me here for dinner last night. This place is a 5-star in all it's forms. Their menu has excellent selections with creative items but not doing too much; everything is straight to the point with awesome ingredients. We shared everything like family style. We started off with house cut fries & three dips and house-made chicken liver pâté with buttered toast. It also came with sweet onion marmalade and grainy mustard which provided a nice kick. For our main course, we shared two pizzas and a pasta. The pizzas are on point! They're cooked by brick-oven style with a nice flat crust. We had a pizza topped with Starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula,and special green dressing which was out of this world. This pizza was fresh and full of flavors. The bacon was cooked to perfection and provided a nice salty bite to it. Our second pizza was topped with house-made chorizo, sunny eggs and cilantro. The egg yolk provided some texture while the chorizo was flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness. Their pizzas here are very creative and a must-get! Our service was great! The food is cooked form scratch but is delivered to your table on time! The ambiance is great too with dim lighting and an outside seating area for a more lively vibe. Their cocktails are of course unique with different mixes. My favorite was their Starbelly 75 which had Dolin Dry, Lillet Blanc, ginger, cava, and lemon. My cocktail was a bit carbonated which was nice! It wasn't heavy nor was it dull. It had the taste of punch soda but had that cocktail form and taste! It was simply amazing.If you're in SF and looking for a spot to eat for dinner, you should include this onto your list. You can't go wrong here.",311,1742,120
"Post-Barry's BrunchWhat a better way to spend a Saturday than workout and brunch? I went to Barry's Castro with a friend, and we rewarded ourselves with Starbelly. The service was great! We had the perfect amount of time to catch up and look at the menu before ordering our food. They were super accommodating and let us order the chicken liver pâté, which was not on the weekend brunch menu. It was perfectly toasted bread drizzled with olive oil. The pâté was accompanied with delicious mustard and marmalade, too.I had the fish tacos and a mimosa, which were really good. Ate it all! My friend had a fried chicken sandwich, which she also enjoyed. She also wanted an Irish coffee, which wasn't on the menu, but they offered her a latte with a whiskey shot. Love the ingenuity!",138,779,59
"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT. Starbelly used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but after this experience it is now my LEAST favorite. Made a reservation for three people a few days prior and when we showed up, we were made to wait ten minutes only to be seated at a table where we couldn't get anyone's attention. It was clearly the shitty table - the one with the cold metal furniture tucked inside this makeshift outdoor dining tent. Once seated, we waited another 15 minutes just to get some water and ONE menu. I stood up to find the host, and he must have seen me coming because only then did he come with water and the menu. IMMEDIATELY after handing it to us, the host asked us for our order. We obviously didn't get the chance to read it yet, so he said that he would be back later. Never came back, so we tried to flag down two servers. They both either did not see us or flat out ignored us, waiting on other tables that had already been served food. We sat there for ANOTHER 20 minutes without anyone coming to check on us. At this point, we were extremely thirsty and desperately trying to get someone to pay attention. I ended up joining a waitlist for another restaurant. Guess what? We actually had fast and friendly service there even though both restaurants were equally busy! Walking away from Starbelly, we noticed that our table was immediately filled with a new party. That tells me that they had been watching our table and just chose not to help us. I understand being busy and maintaining a new set of rules due to the pandemic, but you should prioritize guests who have been waiting for so long. No apologies for the delay were ever exchanged. Before anyone thinks that it was at all my party's fault for the terrible service, know that we were patient with them the entire time and gave them the correct information for the reservation. They simply chose to ignore us, stealing an hour of our time. Don't eat here. Don't entertain this place at all. This may be a popular and busy restaurant, but they should never forget why - the business of the guests. Put them first.",394,2130,174
"Overall good, flavorful food. Pizza was baked well and crust had the right crispiness, French toast was also good but could have been a little more moist (the conserve didn't really do it for me). A friend got a couple cocktails and said they were amazing so don't miss out on the drinks!",53,288,23
"My friend and I came here to celebrate my birthday on a Sunday night and MAN the place was poppin'. It felt more like a Friday night pre-game than a Sunday night weekend winddown. Thankfully, we had reservations so we were able to get seated almost immediately. They have a great selection of cocktails for all different tastes (fruity, less fruity, etc.). I went with Strawberry Alarm Clock, which was exactly what I   was craving. Fruity, light, and bubbly..but adult. For our dinner, we ordered the mussels for our starter and the starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula & green goddess dressing pizza. Both were excellent! The broth that came with the mussels was super flavorful and the waitress was nice enough to bring us extra pieces of bread so we could soak up the leftover broth. The pizza has a super thin crispy crust, but was topped with a generous amount of toppings. I thought the combination of flavors from the bacon, jalapeno, veggies, and the creamy dressing was great as well! Just FYI, portions are on the smaller side, so I would err on the side of ordering a bit more, especially if you are coming with a hungry group.",201,1137,79
"This was our first time dining at Starbelly in the Castro. It was fantastic! The food was really, really great. We ordered the vegan veggie burger (dried pea and quinoa patty, cucumbers and white been puree). It was outstanding actually, one of the best veggie burgers we've ever had, anywhere, ever. It was perfectly grilled and flavored. Amazing. Their house cut fries go perfectly with this burger (ordered separately), were also super tasty. Comfort food on steroids. We really loved this experience last night (1/14/18). The service was good, not exceptional but completely acceptable. The only bummer was that 3 of the wines by the glass we selected were out of stock. Despite that, our server guided us toward some decent Argentina wines that were quite good.This place was great and the fact they can accommodate a vegan diet without any issues was extra special. It's got a great ascetic interior design, nice tables and overall great vibe. I would definitely suggest making a restoration like we did otherwise you're going to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table on a busy night. We'll be back for sure.",190,1115,62
"Pros:* Ambiance of the place is great. I came during a warm weather though. So it wasn't cold, windows were open. Lights were dim, a bit romantic as well.* Margherita pizza was great. We got the cheese add-on for an extra $4 or $5, it's so creamy. Though you'd probably be fine without getting it. I personally wouldn't get it again, I'd rather use the extra money for getting another appetizer.* The brussel sprout was phenomenal. You definitely need to try it.Cons:* None that I could think of. At least my experience there was enjoyable, nothing to complain. It was a quick in and out.Conclusion:Will probably come back again to try their brunch. Dinner, will probably not, unless I'm really craving their food type. I personally like Asian food more, so I'm definitely biased here.",135,785,41
"Came here for restaurant week and had a 3 course lunch for $15! Ordered the pate, chicken poboy, and pot de creme for dessert. Chicken liver pate: 5/5! So delicious and they gave a generous portion. Served with two pieces of bread, marmalade and mustard. I personally was putting both the marmalade and mustard on the bread, topped with the pate. All three blended together well and balanced each other out. Chicken poboy: 3.5/5. Poboy was a decent size, definitely enough to fill you up, but not be overly full. I wasn't the biggest fan of the breading of the chicken and I feel the sandwich was missing some heat (sriracha helped a little with that). Chicken was moist inside and the bun was super soft. Dessert: 5/5 salted caramel pot de creme was freakin delicious! Texture was spot. The little bits of salt on top as well as the savory cookie (rosemary) combat the sweetness of be creme. Perfect pairing!",161,909,59
"Nice ambiance. Sat at the back enclosed area, which is nice that it's enclosed. Ordered Dr's Order drink, which was okay. Flavor wasn't very strong. Ordered pate, which is my favorite. It comes with bread, sweet onion marmalade and grain mustard. The sweet onion marmalade is very good with the pate!  Got the cheddar cheese grit sticks. It comes in 3, which is a tad pricey, but the dill aioli was good with it. Also ordered the mushroom onion pizza. It was pretty tasty too.",85,476,30
"After a boozy noon at the Lucky 13, my buddies and I struck out get something to eat.  One of them suggested Starbelly saying that it was his regular late afternoon lunch spot.  I didn't argue and we meandered to restaurant.  My concern was that it would be packed and we'd have a long wait.  Fortunately, it wasn't and we were sat immediately.  After a quick review of the menu I asked what type of cuisine it was, and buddy said new American.  I don't get out much as I used to but I had not heard of that.  It was good though.I ordered the fried chicken Po Boy sandwich with french fries.  Basically, it's a fried chicken breast with a jalapeno & radicchio slaw.  Man, it was good.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The addition of jalapenos was a surprise, but brilliant with the slaw.  Wow, really awesome.  The shoestring fries were delicious and plentiful.  Sometimes restaurants drop the ball on the fries, but Starbelly scores.  For me, thick-cut fries would not have paired well with the Po Boy.  This was a place I would not have chosen, and thankfully my buddy made the call.  I'd be happy to go back anytime, and will.",212,1163,85
"Yummy little spot, nice ambience indoor and on the back patio. Menu selection is small but delicious, and service was enjoyable as well. Great brunch spot :)",27,157,8
"Stopped here last Thursday with a group of friends for one of our birthdays. It was pretty good. The service was so so and the food was also just so so, but overall a good experience. We ordered a slew of appetizers - the potato sticks, calamari, and some others. Nothing stood out as great to me. We then ordered a burger and the mushroom pizza and split it. The pizza was just okay, nothing special, but the burger was solid! Cooked perfectly and had everything we wanted. Fries good too. I think the best part was the drinks. I ordered a mescal cocktail and got it extra spicy - yummy! Very good and refreshing and spicy just like I like it. Service was pretty good, ambiance was even better. Probably wouldn't come back except to try the brunch cus the fried chicken and waffles looks good!",147,794,55
"I came here for boozy brunch and found the food subpar. House Made Chorizo, Sunny Eggs & Cilantro (5/10): I guess sunny eggs weren't meant to be on a pizza?Bibb Lettuce (4/10): This one comes with ""green goddess"" lettuce plus grilled chicken, bacon and cherry tomatoes. Pretty flavorless :/",49,290,11
"I liked the food and ambiance here. It's got a modern look with sidewalk booths, inside seating, and a back patio area. They took reservations. I ordered the Cobb salad which came with chicken, bacon, and green goddess dressing. The dressing did not have a strong or remarkable taste but the salad was good overall. The pate was very delicious. I was glad to try since I've never had pate before. My only negative was that the server was slow: it took a while to give our order, and I had to ask him two times for the same request. Nonetheless I would return.",104,559,40
"Dined in recently for a birthday party.  I was late, but made it in time for a few of their starters. The ground chorizo and peppers were plentiful in the roasted Black Mussels dish, and the sauce went very well with toast.  I also had the pleasure in tasting their house made chicken pate.  Light and flavorful, this pate lived up to it's reputation!  We also shared some pizzas. Their Margherita with fresh mozzarella was pretty average, in a good way!  The Market Mushroom with Gruyere tasted fantastic.  It was filled with mushrooms, and unfortunately was way on the soggy side.  But their house made chorizo with cilantro pizza was superb!  The star of my belly that night was the burger.  But not any ordinary burger.  I had it Doc's way...which is not on the menu.  The fact that they even have a secret menu gives me more excitement to dine here.  But it's all about their chicken liver pate. Their burger Doc's Way is the Prather ranch patty with the addition of a humongous slice of pate.  The abundance of pickles and onions weren't needed much as the onion marmalade and chicken liver pate had an overwhelming presence.  Although the burger was a bit overcooked to my liking, the fat layer of pate made up for it.  I'll request a medium rare on my next visit.  Yes, there will be a next time!  And with flawless service, how can I resist?",242,1350,102
Always looking for that delicious clean and safe restaurant. In our usual travels we look for the best and that's what we got. The place is spotless and the food delicious. Online reservations make the experience that much more enjoyable and easier in not-so-easy times.,45,270,18
"Cute, hip restaurant in Castro! Honestly, this general area is so much fun. Lots of bars. Lots of life - so definitely come here for dinner and continue partying elsewhere in the district! Vegetarian friendly - but not vegan friendly - so if you're a strict vegan, your money would be put to better use at a different restaurant. I ordered the spaghetti dish which is topped with starbelly bacon, jalapeno, basil, and shaved grana. Super yummy, 5/5 for flavor + value. Their cocktails are on point. I really want to say I ordered Pimm's Cup (and it was rimmed with fresh cucumber) but I'm not sure. If you see it on the menu, get it! Overall, come thru. Starbelly is a fun time~",124,678,43
Excellent food and kind service. I'm pretty hard to please do this is a BIG compliment!,16,87,6
"Went here to catch up with friends and it was great! They have fun cocktails to order and all the food was very tasty. We had fries, chicken liver pate, burger, pizza and steak. The atmosphere is fun and our server was really nice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was so loud we struggled to hear one another. Therefore I wouldn't recommend sitting inside if you want to chat to those at the table.",81,422,38
We got the butternut squash dumplings as our starter and the doctors order & turmeric tonic to drink! So yummy!,20,111,6
"I wanted to love Starbelly so badly on a wonderful recommendation from my friend but I would have to say my food experience here was mediocre. The cheddar cheese grit sticks were an interesting spin on polenta I suppose - gooey and soft on the inside and fried to a crisp on the outside. These were an interesting item on the menu.My friend swore by the pate, which was pretty good but nothing to drive home about. The bread was thick and crusty with a standard chicken liver spread that is quite classy for a date night. The pizzas here are pretty unique and deliciously crafted. As someone spoiled by NYC pizza, I would give the Starbelly pizza around a 3.75 out of 5, which is pretty good. We got the unique roasted corn, white cheddar, Aleppo chile, cilantro & lime aioli one. It has a cool Mexican spin with the sweet corn mixed in the cheese. I got a prickly pear cocktail, which was a pretty good as well. Overall, I would say Starbelly has decent new American fare, with a west coast Hispanic influence.",186,1011,66
"Loved it! Came here with 4 people on Sunday evening and the vibe was amazing, we sat on the patio and really enjoyed it. We got the flatbread and white beans for an appetizer and it was super creamy and a nice way to start off the meal. Non-alcoholic drinks were also on point and fair-priced too. We also got Margherita Pizza, the burger, and spaghetti - all of which we enjoyed a lot. It was a great time! I want to try brunch here.",85,434,35
"I have have eaten at this place a handful of time and every time I was disappointed.  Today was the worst of them all.  The host up front was so RUDE and dismissive.  After waiting for almost 10 minutes to be greater he shouted ""WAIT"" from across the room as if I haven't been standing there this whole time.  In addition when he finally handed me my food, he basically threw it at me.  The food was okay at best.  Chicken was not fully cooked or cut on the salad.  Portion was small.  I'm never coming back here again.  The owner should really evaluate their stuff because they are killing the business!",112,604,50
This place was pretty good. Their sweet potato soup was mildly disappointing as it was a little bland. Loved their catfish and risotto though. The bartenders were friendly. The drinks were strong AF.,33,199,10
"The perfect spot for a boozy brunch.  This might be the best red sangria that I've ever had.   Usually when you order sangria, it's so watered down that you wonder if you've had a drink.  One of these and you're not fit to drive.  Two and you're ready to bar hop in the Castro.  Great heated outdoor patio.  Fun crowd.  Friendly and attentive staff.  What we ordered: Loco moco medium rare with side of avocado Rounds and rounds of red sangria Side of friesCheers!",85,464,34
"A great place for brunch with a group! Came here with a group of 6, definitely recommend making a reservation in advance if possible. We were seated right when we got there, and I requested to be seated on the patio which we did get! The patio is great--it's covered everywhere but natural light does come in. It's a good size and perfect for brunch.Service was good! The only slight downfall was that one of the dishes came out much sooner than the others, which can be hard when waiting for a group.  Food was great though, I ended up splitting the chilaquiles and roasted corn pizza--the corn pizza was something that was brought back to the menu and it was delicious! Chilaquiles were good too, and came with a side salad with goat cheese.They do not have bottomless mimosas but they do have a menu of other drinks including mimosas. Would recommend!",153,854,69
"New favorite spot!!! Went here for brunch and fell in love. Place is so cute, friendly service, we hung out for a long time there and never felt rushed. We went for brunch, but I can't wait to come back to try happy hour or dinner. I had a Bloody Mary that was delicious, but all of their cocktails looked fantastic. Highly recommend coming here!",65,346,25
"Came here to celebrate a birthday during brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon. Luckily we had reservations, so getting seated was a breeze. The food was fantastic and the drinks were great! We really enjoyed ourselves and part of that was due to the great food and drinks we had here. The only thing I would say that could of improved is to have some fans in the back section. The cover does keep the sun off you, but doesn't let a breeze easily flow, so the back does get a bit toasty. Other than that keep up the great work!",101,523,48
"The wait staff here will not get within a certain radius of your table if you are the only three brown folks there. No silverware, no water refill, no approaching to take the order, nothing, no thank you for coming, no how are you doing. Every SINGLE table with white folks nearby got those things without question. Thankfully the Chicano busser did much of the waiter's job for him, wouldn't want the waiter to be exposed to the melanin.",79,438,35
"Went here with a friend while visiting San Fran and was disappointed by the food.Service was good and it was very packed, so seems like they get good business. I appreciate that the menu is seasonal, which means that there are fresh and new options every few months. However, the fish that I ordered tasted so...fishy. I've never had fish that tasted like this - I think they hadn't prepared it properly, so the stink was very pungent and strong. My friends steak was also sub-par, especially at the prices we paid. We just expected something better given the good reviews and upscale quality of the restaurant. The pate was good though - just be sure to ask for extra bread!We also sat beneath a bookshelf at the back of the restaurant that seemed a little precarious. One little earthquake and I was worried the books would come crashing down!",150,845,61
"::FOOD:: 1/5 I mean it is edible, but it's flavorless. We ordered a burger, a Sunnyside Joe's, a Loco Moco, a Caesar salad, and a wild mushroom pizza. While the pizza tasted great, the rest of the food that involved meat was FLAVORLESS. Literally, no salt at all, all we tasted was, MEAT.::SERVICE:: 1/5 Water was never refilled, drinks were thrown on the table as if we wronged the waitress. She came over and asked, ""is everything good?"" I said, ""no"" but maybe she didn't hear me, she just walked away. ::PORTION:: 1/5 - the portion of everything was quite small for the price point. They are trying to make it fancy/fine-dining-like, but it isn't a place for that. Their Loco Moco was so small and taste less it's not worth ordering. It's basically a scoop of rice, a beef patty that's a little bigger than the slider size and an egg on top with a ""sweet soy sauce"" (basically a teriyaki sauce) not a typical Loco Moco brown gravy sauce.::AMBIENCE:: 3/5 it's pretty standard, nothing special. A typical gastro pub setting.::SUMMARY:: Wouldn't recommend to anyone of my friends to waste their money when there are so many better places to go to around the area.",206,1163,80
"One of the few brunch places where you can make a reservation so you don't get trapped in a line with no end (Kitchen Story, Brenda's, etc). It was full of people at 1pm, and we ended up in a corner behind the bar, but still got good service and attention. I ordered the Sunnyside Joe's, and the waiter nicely let me replace the potatoes with a side salad. My friend had the Loco Moco. The first thing I noticed when my dish came was that the eggs were unevenly cooked. One of them was super watery and gooey, while the other's yolk was fully cooked. The ground beef wasn't well-seasoned and didn't contribute much to the dish besides taking up space. My friend's Loco Moco was a little less disappointing; the sauce was apparently good, especially having soaked into the rice. But the problem with this place is that the portions are SO SMALL. It's not right to pay ~$15 for a plate of eggs and meat that won't fill you up. Make plans for dessert afterwards or order a French Toast to share. Otherwise, you'll leave unsatisfied.",189,1029,81
"I came back here today since I was in the area and enjoyed it so much last time. We were quickly seated by the bartender out to the beautiful patio in the back. We were greeted by our server and left to look over our menus. My fiancé ordered the fried chicken with French toast and an IPA and I ordered the least coast burger again, but this time I added cooked onions and blue cheese. I ordered my burger lettuce wrapped because I am gluten intolerant. Our waiter took our order without writing anything down.  I was disappointed to see my burger came out with a bun, but the server said he would get it fixed. I wish he had asked if I wanted them to make another or if it was ok for him to just lay it over lettuce. I would have preferred another, but they just lettuce wrapped the first one. When I got my plate back, my fries were cold. Still tasty, but not fresh tasting. It was just disappointing after my first visit here. My fiancé really loved his French toast and chicken- he said even though it was fried chicken, it didn't feel heavy and that the French toast was cooked perfectly. I still love the lavender lemonade! Side note: the bathroom needs more lighting. It's like walking into a haunted house- it is so dark! Overall, I am a bit disappointed with this visit. My food was nowhere near the quality that it was when I went the first time. I will likely come back, but I will be hesitant.",268,1405,108
"Holy. Moley. This place was AH-MAZING!  Cute little gastropub in San Francisco. We came in right at opening on a Wednesday for brunch/lunch. The menu is extensive and gluten Free friendly. The servers were knowledgeable about what can be prepared gluten free and what couldn't be. There was plenty of seating available, and they have this beautiful patio in the back of the restaurant and which is a great place to sit for some fresh air and to unwind. Our server was super friendly and was on top of everything we needed. Food wise, this was one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. I ordered their burger and had it lettuce wrapped, and added white cheddar and avocado. It was SO good and you can really taste how fresh it is. It doesn't taste frozen at all. They serve this with a heaping portion of fries and offer green goddess dressing upon request for dipping. My dad ordered the chiliquiles and he was in HEAVEN! They looked amazing, and smelled so good. He said the amount of flavor was unlike any others he had had before. I also got a lavender lemonade with my meal which wasn't overly sweet- it was just right with a perfect twist of lavender. Overall, I will for sure be back here and recommend to all my friends!",225,1233,99
"I don't really post on Yelp but had such a great experience at Starbelly! It was my first time there. I met up with a friend for a quick catch-up, we sat outdoors in the parklet. Super friendly and attentive service, amazing food (lots of vegetarian options for people like me) and reasonably priced. Seems like a great place to go with both smaller and larger groups. I look forward to dining there again and see this as being a great go-to!",82,442,34
"Eh. I mean this place does have a nice selection of food but I would stick to what's popular and skip the experimental items. We ordered the fig salad- it was good but we could have skipped this one. Fried Grits- the dipping sauce was excellent but the grits itself needed more salt or at least some sea salt on the outside of the sticks. We asked for recommendations and they had a seasonal pizza which I thought was sad...It was the corn pizza that was bland. One thing...Don't go to star belly for their pizzas.. I did like the chicken pate and thought it was a great portion and it was house made!All in all I just couldn't catch on the hype sadly, I would have loved to!",129,675,59
The wait was too long at another restaurant a block away so we strolled into this one. The food was fairly good. Loved the vibes here. Food:Donuts - goodFish tacos - goodSalted caramel pot de creme - good,38,204,10
"The worst loco moco I've ever had. Dry af across the board. The spaghetti is a little below mediocre. These dishes aren't restaurant quality, period. Drinks are wine and beer only, but they make fair attempts at cocktails with what they've got. Plus one star for that. Our main server seemed nice, though slightly uncomfortable, so plus one star for him. Finally, I'm awarding a star for the sort of outdoor seating. I'll take what I can get in SF, in this regard.",83,464,24
"First of: awesome customer service! From greeting to seating to checking up on us. It was great. Place is very clean and atmosphere is lively. Now the food: The pate was amazing! Love the onion marmalade and the mustard was on point. The mussels were impeccable! And I'm not a great seafood fan so props on making a fabulous dish. The mushroom pizza was very rich so expect a punch of a flavor. But that was already too much for me so we had to box it home. Overall, loved it. I will definitely be back for brunch on a Sunday anytime!",102,534,43
"Good for drinks. Another classic over-crowded ""alright"" brunch place. First, their service has been quite rude the past two times I've been there. I don't blame the staff, but the management seems to do shady things like - having their lunch menu on SF restaurant week, but not offering it on the weekends and not noting that anywhere on the menu.I've been here twice - once for drinks, and once for brunch. Would recommend as a cute drink place, but not going to be a go-to for food for me.For brunch, I got the sunny side joe's, which was bland and eggs were way over cooked. We also got charged for all small changes (sub arugula for cilantro on a pizza and charged $2 without telling us).",127,692,53
"The fava bean dumplings were *chef's kiss* the perfect savory bite. It was creamy, savory, and a little tangy. I loved how it was such a unique item and executed so well. The price point for the dish was a little steep at $2.5 per dumpling. The veggie burger was huge and came with a small mountain of fries. There was no indication of fries coming with the burger and maybe I should have asked, so I also ordered the fries with 3 dips. The fries were just as fries should be in taste and texture, but a lot of the pieces were quite short. The veggie patty exterior was crunchy and the bun was soft and fluffy. Maybe it's just my personal preference, but I wanted a saucier burger with a sharper flavor. The service was good.",138,725,58
"We were in SF for a friend's birthday and she selected this place for brunch. The atmosphere is nice and the patio seating looked cool. The place was very packed on a Saturday morning I wouldn't expect any less. The service was pretty quick for our party of 11. The drinks were all pretty good I loved mine which had gin and elderberry, but I can't remember the name of it. I ordered the French toast but wasn't a fan of the fruit jam or whatever it was that was spread onto it. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles which I tried and liked. The chicken was moist and the waffles were great.",114,596,48
Went here recently for lunch/brunch. The fried chicken and waffles was mediocre...the chicken was over cooked and dry. The batter was also flavorless. Their pizza was actually good - we tried one with egg on it and I would definitely order it again. Service was below average...an order for a beer during lunch took 10-15 minutes to arrive and didn't make it to the table until after we finished eating. The wait staff here seemed a bit apathetic.,78,447,31
"Cute spot, came here on a Wednesday night to catch up with some friends. There's a lot of street metered parking but the no left turns are a pain.  The food was pretty good!Appetizer: Their house made mushroom dumplings were to die for! Honestly I've had my fair share of dumplings and I wasn't expecting too much, the wrap was so amazing, it melted in my mouth. There were different layers of wraps and delicious cheese as well. It was pretty pricey though, around $11 for 3 dumplings, lol. We also had the chicken patte which was also very delicious. I enjoyed the sweet raspberry (?) sauce that it came with! Very delicious and worth trying. Main dishes: I had their spaghetti which the waitress recommended as a good start when trying out this spot, it had bacon pieces in it with thick noodles (almost like thick chow mein noodles). The sauce was a little spicy and the bacon was a good touch! The house made bangers & mash was soo good as well! It came with delicious meat with mash potatoes, sausages and apples! I loved it lol. I wasn't expecting the apples to be so delicious in the dish!Overall this spot had really interesting dishes. The waitress also told us sometimes the dishes switch around , but I enjoyed pretty much everything! Im definitely down to try different dishes here the next time I come!",237,1316,85
"One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. 1) you don't have to wake up at an ungodly hour to go and wait for a table (I'm looking at you Plow) and 2) great service, ambience and food, what more could you ask for? They've got a great outdoor back patio with heat lamps and it's super cozy and airy and bright. I haven't been for dinner, but I've been for brunch many times and it's always been excellent. Make sure to get the chicken and waffles and wash it down with a mimosa. Nothing better.",97,495,45
"Looking for a brunch spot where the price and service are up to par? In SF? With a full bar? Great menu selection? And very hipster? Try out Starbelly.  You wont regret it.  The hostess and our server were super nice.  Service was fast. And the price was just right for the plate you get.I recommend you try their ""house made chicken liver pãté with buttered bread, grain mustard and sweet onion marmalade"" (so good!)  Very light and satisfying plate and did I mention really good?!  You get a balance of sweet and salty & moist and savory.  I really liked it.  Their house cut fries with three dipping sauce was also bomb.  Great way to start  our brunch.  We also ordered their spaghetti with bacon, jalapeño, and basil. Yummy!   And one can never go wrong with their pizza margherita with fresh mozzarella and basil just because we didn't order enough carbs today. Hahaha!  There is an indoor and outdoor eating area.  The outdoor is fully tented which is aesthetically pleasing because you get the outdoor experience without having your hair blowing in your face and no flies fighting to taste your food selection!   The howling wind was nice to hear beat against the fully covered tent.  Succulents mounted on the walls were relaxing.  Nice touch.Did I mention they are furry friendly too? Cool!",226,1300,74
"Yum this place has great food and great service! They have a cute outdoor seating area in the back of the restaurant and it's slightly covered, which is great because you get the sunniness of being outdoors without overheating...I came on labor day weekend, and since my sister was visiting, we had a large party. The server was really accommodating and even split the bill for us as we requested! I tried the loco moco (plus avocado), chicken and waffles, and the burger. The chicken and waffles was good - I've had better ones elsewhere, but starbelly's was pretty decent. Everything we ate was pretty good, not amazing but definitely satisfying.We also tried their caramel pot de creme, which was delicious! It's a tiny pot of caramel pudding like stuff with some shortbread cookies on the side. Perfect for dessert!",140,819,54
"I came here past 1pm to have lunch. I don't really like giving 3 stars or less just because I know how hard it is to run a restaurant. But during my visit, the place wasn't packed. They don't looked understaffed. The place is nicely decorated but service is inattentive, we only saw our server once (during order taking), we had to get someone's attention every time we needed help; from getting a table, ordering, paying our tab. The loco moco is very tasty with their sweet sauce, but it should not be called loco moco coz loco moco is about gravy. I was looking forward to try the gravy, but there was no gravy, it was this sweet sauce which is very tasty. I liked the dish, it's just I was really looking for gravy. The French Toast is sweeter than usual since they cover the entire top bread with strawberry jam, it would have been good if it has less jam so I can actually taste the flavor of the toast itself. The POBOY chicken sandwich is good. This is one of their best stuff.",187,985,80
"This was my fourth time at Starbelly. We opted for a late brunch on Saturday this weekend. Our reservations were made in advance and we were seated as soon as we arrived.The seasonal corn and cilantro pizza had a delicious thin and crispy crust. With lime aioli drizzled on top, this pie is one of the best in SF. Our Starbelly Salad was fresh and toped with candy sweet cherry tomatoes and creamy goat cheese. A more generous portion of both was needed (we still had half a bowl of greens after we ate the fixings with the rest of the salad).The wait staff was almost too attentive. Within three minutes we were asked by three separate employees if they could take out plates. We were still working on our meals and would have appreciated better communication between the front of house team.",143,793,59
"If I'm being honest, I liked the atmosphere here better than the food. I ordered the spaghetti which had quite a bit of hype here on Yelp, and I've got to say... it kind of failed to live up to the high expectations I had. It was just a basic plate of spaghetti with some chopped up jalapeños and chunks of the non-fatty part of pork belly. It was OK. Would I order it again? Probably not. On the contrary, my friend loved it and raved about it to some of our coworkers the next day... so maybe it's a case of different strokes for different folks. :/",108,551,49
"Pretty good service. Food was eh-ok, nothing to rave about. Had the fries appetizers, the dips were pretty bland, the ""basil aioli"" not much flavor at all. Had the Otro Diablo cocktail, definitely lacked some punch, disappointing. Tasted pretty water down or something, not sure how to explain. The good news, is they had some great beers on draft. The spaghetti pasta was tasty! The leftover spaghetti sauce ended up being a great dipping sauce for our leftover pizza crust. LOL - The broccoli pizza could've used some extra olive oil + garlic. The po-boy chicken was a hit. All in all, it was an ""okay"" dinner, but probably won't return. Something was missing. Palms facing up??",117,680,36
"Starbelly has a nice bright patio in the back with bench seating. They can also easily accommodate large groups.I've only been here a few times for lunch, where it's quiet and uncrowded. The mushroom pizza is always a favorite, with the Starbelly pizza a close second. The spaghetti is great in its simplicity. The bibb salad was pretty fresh and nicely balanced. Others seemed to enjoy the burger on challah bun.Solid place for a solid meal.",76,442,30
I freakin love this place so much. Delicious food and good vibes. The patio seating is super cute!! I love the Starbelly Bacon Pizza and Brussels sprouts ughhhh obsessed is an understatement!! Def one of my fave places in the city.,41,231,12
"An interesting thing happens when people ask for restaurant recommendations in the Castro:  They're steered away from Castro Street itself and you can see them pointing back down the street with a questioning look on their face saying ""nothing in that direction?""  Nothing in that direction.  Starbelly fills a void in the 'hood that's seemingly missing from Castro Street itself.  Brunch, lunch, and dinner are served 7-days per week (though not round-the-clock) in an upscale, ""now"" environment.  Think light wood furnishings, a menu written entirely in lower case font, and plates featuring Prather Ranch burgers, Little Gem salads, dishes with added aged-cheddar, and house-pickled jalapeños.  The fact that you recognize this menu as being from the time we live in is what distinguishes it from some other open-all day places directly on Castro.  At any time I'd say the place to dine here is the back patio.  In fact, for a recent weekday lunch I walked through an essentially empty restaurant to reach that attractive (and packed) al fresco spot.  On a beautiful day, everything will look better from here.  My waiter approached with big, full bottles of still and sparkling water and my table opted for both.  I was relieved to learn that there was no upsell here.  Even sparkling water, which they apparently carbonate themselves on-site, was provided free of charge. My salad (Bibb lettuce, grilled chicken, bacon, cherry tomatoes, & green goddess dressing, $13) was presented beautifully and was well-priced for a filling lunchtime meal in such an attractive setting.  Could the salad have benefited from crispier bacon and more ample and flavorful dressing?  It could have, but the fact that it didn't wasn't a dealbreaker.I think that Starbelly is a great (though far from recent) addition to the neighborhood: Good food, reasonable pricing, free and ample sparkling water.  When people ask, I will happily and confidently point them away from Castro Street and towards Starbelly's patio for an enjoyable experience.",324,2029,117
Came here for lunch today after not having been for years and it was terrible from start to finish. I ordered a salad with fried chicken on it and the chicken was undercooked and gross not to mention they forgot the avocado. I asked for the avocado three times and finally when I was nearly done with my salad someone brought it. Not great meal combine with the inattentive service means I won't be coming back again,77,416,36
"When I saw Starbelly's $15 lunch on the 2019 SF Restaurant Menu website, I thought it was a mistake. Once I arrived, however, I realized I was about to chow down on one of the week's best valued menus. AMBIANCE is lovely. I'm a huge fan of natural wood, and the space is full of it.  There's tables for 2-4 in the front of the restaurant, and bar seating available as well. From a glance, there's more seating in the back for larger parties (and outdoor seating as well). ORDERED House made chicken liver pate, fried chicken po' boy, salted caramel pot de creme with a cornmeal rosemary cookie ($15 total), and a delicious cocktail whose name I can't recall.FOOD was incredible. I loved the pate- probably the largest serving size I've received at a restaurant as well. The fried chicken sandwich was nice, light and crisp, and the pot de creme was the perfect way to end the meal.OVERALL Starbelly gets a filling four stars. Can't wait to come back and try their menu again soon!",177,980,55
"Starbelly brings all the boys to the yard.And they're like, it's better than yours.D**n right it's better than yours.They can teach you, but they have to charge.A particularly rainy evening brought my friend and I to this yard, specifically the back patio for some catching up over great food. I'd always eyed Starbelly in the many times I've been down to the 'Stro yet they escaped my mind after I stopped coming down here every weekend. Glad my friend suggested this place!We were seated and given menus by a particularly bubbly hostess. The back patio is quite nice with some viney foliage and nice shelter from an otherwise torrential rain (I've never lived in a tropical area so I imagine my depiction is a little over exaggerated). We had a nice little two seater which made for a very intimate conversation about all the trouble we'd been getting into. Even with the other diners talking rather loudly, we managed to be able to hear each other.The menu is smallish but I was able to zero in on some good vittles. I believe we settled on the Bread & Olive Oil to share which wasn't too filling, I appreciate that. My main however ended up being the Country style Italian sausage, soft polenta, sweet onions, peppers & tomato dish. Absolutely fresh and delicious as I expected it to be. I even ate it much slower than I usually do because I had a lot to say to my friend and he didn't need to be a recipient like a person in the front row of a Gallagher comedy show.All in all a great place that I want to come back to soon!!!",281,1531,117
"Visited this place while passing through on our way up to Napa. They were still serving their lunch/brunch menu. It was the middle of day, so it wasn't too busy! We opted for outdoor patio seating. Perfect day for outdoor dining at the time of visit. We ordered the Starbelly pizza which consisted of bacon, arugula, jalapeño and some green sauce on top. The pizza was tasty, gave it enough heat with the jalapeño. We also ordered the fried chicken po'boy sandwich. The slaw that came on it, was perfect. It's got heat, but not too much, as I can't handle heat as much as I used to...lol! Oh, this place was featured on Secret Eats with Adam Richman. They have an off the menu burger called Doc's Way Burger with bacon jam, chicken pâté. I would have ordered it, but was really craving pizza at the time.",148,804,55
"Had to update my previous review given recent food quality for pick-up orders. I know we're all living in uncertain times, and I'm pretty flexible all things considered--however, the quality of lettuce in the Bibb Lettuce Salad (aka Butter Lettuce Salad) was pretty bad. I also asked for a well done burger, and ended up having to cook it for about 10m longer on a cast iron griddle once I got it home. I also didn't get my dipping sauces for a large order of cold fries either (and I live pretty close to the restaurant). Starbelly is usually up on food quality, including what you pay for & preferences for meat preparation (come on, it's a burger), but after my last two orders, this most recent one shown in my images especially, I will not be ordering anytime soon.",140,770,51
"Such a cozy staple in the neighborhood. Their house-cured bacon and Starbelly Pizza are to die for! Delicious seasonal menu, and their french fries with dipping sauces are a delectable indulgence! Be sure to try their wedge salad if you're looking for something super fresh and tasty!",47,284,17
"5/10 experience and would say that's generous. In the city you can find way tastier and kinder restaurants. The food was decent (nothing special) but what it really lacked was the service. Servers were inattentive -- had to ask for everything: to order, where the food was (long wait), water, to pay, etc and each time waiters seemed quite bothered and unkind. Overall just regret choosing this place, especially as a local taking visitors.",74,440,27
"Let me start out by saying that this place is great for large groups with reservations online starting at  2 people and up. I've never had to endure the SF brunch starve here (where you wait so long you're either hangry or not hungry anymore), not even on a Saturday w/o reservation. ~Food~  This time - challah french toast: Oooo yum. I usually get an egg based brunch but the table next to me was chowing down on some french toast and I had to go with my gut. Thick fluffy challah toast with a generous dollop of fromage (which tasted like cream cheese + soft butter), homemade strawberry jam (perfect balance of sour and sweet), and some sprinkles of chopped up pistachios that completed the whole taste.sunnyside joe's: Food lava served on a mini sizzling pan. It's a combo of ground beef, spinach, cheese, and runny eggs. It's a hot mess so make sure you poke at it with your fork before you take the first bite. I've figured out that dipping the potatoes in it like it's a french onion dip is the best way to go. Another good combo of ingredients but I wish it came with toasted levain instead of potatoes as that would've been great to dip/spread with. Previous times - 2 farmhouse eggs: your standard breakfast plate, good but nothing crazycornmeal crusted fish tacos: already comes with a generous side salad (or you can sub for the starbelly salad for extra $), they're loaded tacos so be ready to get your hands dirty, fish was good and the spicy slaw gave it an extra kickStarbelly pizza: the pizza was a little underwhelming. It's a thin crust but it was limp, not crunchy. The arugula kind of just fell off of the pizza when you picked up a slice. Flavor was alright but the texture just really turned me off. ~Price/Quality/Quantity~  Brunch price here is on the lower side of the SF brunch scale. I would argue that it's because the portions are also slightly smaller, depending on the plate. For example the loco moco is $11 and it's the smallest plate out of the ""eggs"" section. ~Atmosphere/Service~On the outside, this place is tucked away from Market St with a tiny sign. But once you enter, it's open, airy, and hipster. They have a full bar indoors at the front of the restaurant for all you brunch alcoholics. The back has a covered/greenhouse style patio with seating for large groups. You can get a picnic experience without all the wind, heat, and flies. ~Bottom Line~Underrated brunch, interesting fusions, and perfect for groups.",437,2457,172
"This place is great for happy hour and weekend brunch. Always busy and always friendly. Nice cozy decor and comfy patio area: $20 for happy hour burger and a happy hour cocktail. I had the patio punch with gin and lavender; very good and very refreshing. Nile, the bartender was very friendly and very attentive. Their weekend brunch chilaquiles are off the hook. My 4 star review is based on the food not on the service. The burger was great, the fries not so much. Very tiny pieces; like the left over crumbles you find in the bottom of the frying basket weren't very appealing and seemed kind of dry. Superb device!",112,618,44
"I gave this place a second try.  My friends persuaded me to give it another try.  This time I got the chicken po boy with fries... my friends got the pizza, chicken and waffles, loco moco, and salad.  The best thing was the pizza.  Everything else was all underwhelming for all the hype this place has.  The po boy was really just a chicken sandwich with some cole slaw sandwiched in there.  It was lacking flavor with the batter and chicken regardless of the sauce on it.  The side of fries that came with it were in itty bitty pieces and a bit too crispy and also tasted plain.  I had to add some salt on there.  When I think of po boy I think of southern cooking so I was a bit thrown off.  However, this obviously was their interpretation of a po boy.My partner got a salad, but those are hard to mess up.The place is really nice and there is an outdoor patio, but this won't be my first choice for brunch in Castro.",177,920,73
Terrible service owner was not nice and not welcoming neither the host in the entrance !Had to leave the restaurant with terrible experience will not recommend this place at all.,30,178,14
"I recommend not getting the drinks because it's $9 for ~4oz of mimosa Overall, food was amazing, atmosphere is hip and vibrant with pop music, interesting light fixtures, and suave, modern wooden furniture. I got the chicken and waffles and fmu they were f'ing amazing. Sweet maple syrup atop crunchy chicken and waffles that melt in your mouth made me forget that it was $16 Very expensive, but very bougie. It's definitely getting a star for filling my belly. 4 out of 5.",83,473,31
"I sometimes forget about Starbelly. Which is a mistake. They are consistently consistent in offering good food and drinks. The back patio is a nice touch as well, especially for lunch",31,183,10
"I've been going here for years, and it is always delicious. I especially love the French Toast, Loco Moco, the spinach and egg dish, and the fries. the lavender lemonade is also very good",34,187,14
"I won't lie, I'm extremely behind in writing this review. Like, December 2017 behind.. With that being said, I recall my impressionable dining experience at Starbelly! The inside was very hip and gave off a great ambiance -- warm and welcoming. I felt ""cool"" while eating there, even though cool is subjective. Anyway, the restaurant was packed, so we decided to sit at the community table, which was a new adventure for us. Chloe was our server, who was pleasant. Though small, the menu offered a nice variety. We weren't very hungry, so our order was easy -- Allagash beer, veggie burger with a side of bacon, and warm bread with olive oil as a starter. The prices were moderate and the food quality was fabulous -- very fresh and tasty. Excluding tip, the bill was under $32.00. I look forward to visiting in the near future to see what their current menu has to offer! Update pending...",158,890,61
Nice place for brunch with outdoor seating and dog friendly! Everything I've had here has been amazing. The staff is very friendly and welcoming as well.,26,153,11
"I came with a friend for Sunday brunch and was able to get seated right away. I ordered the chicken and waffle while my friend got the sunnyside Joe's. We were both disappointed by his dish. It was just a basic egg, meat, cheese, onion and spinach dish with potatoes on the side. On the other hand, my chicken and waffles was absolutely scrumptious! It was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like was that the breading was not staying on and kept falling off too easily. I was eating a good but naked chicken the whole time. Service was mediocre. Our waitress was MIA the entire meal and the food took a really long time to come out.",122,654,51
"I'm glad we went back here. The gentleman in front was accommodating in giving us a table considering we didn't have a reservation on a Friday, days after the city opening up. Best mezza platter. My squid ink pasta with crab was delicious. Husband enjoyed his merguez sausage. Our waiter kept checking to see how we we're doing. I like that. We'll definitely be back.",65,367,20
I'll never know if their food was good or not. Host who clearly saw us arrived first but helped lighter people instead. Wanted to eat outdoor but she sat us inside. Sat down for 5 minutes and left.,38,197,12
"This restaurant reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, Herb and Biter. I loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant, and really liked the backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating area.I made reservations for 3 just to ensure we got a table, and did so only a few hours in advance. I got the time that I was hoping for. It got pretty busy with many walk-in's (we were near the front so I could easily see and hear), so if and when I go back I will make reservations again. That being said, I think you could be seated with little wait if you did not make a reservation.I ordered the margarita pizza and added chorizo, and I'm glad I did because it would have been a little underwhelming if I hadn't. The pizza had good flavor and I really liked the basil? which is weird because who says that, but it was memorable. The service was great! Our server was funny and helpful throughout the meal.My friends got the steak and the burger and they both really enjoyed their meals as well!",189,1008,78
"A GREAT hip brunch place in Castro!I love Starbelly! I came here for brunch and there was about an hour wait. We decided to wait and walked around Castro. I'm so glad that I waited because it was worth the wait! We ordered chicken&waffle, starbelly pizza and Prather's ranch skillet breakfast. The portion was more than enough for three ppl. Chicken and waffle was average. I think it's because I prefer crispy waffle but chicken was decent!  BUT their pizza and that skillet breakfast were sooo good! It seemed like every table has at least one of these! Pizza was amazing! Thin crust, generous amount of arugula with kick of jalapeños! I'd definitely get it next time maybe different flavor because I don't want to miss out! The service was outstanding. I accidentally left my to-go box there and one of staff ran outside to get me and hand me the box. That was so nice of them! Outstanding service, decent food and good vibes! I'd like to come here for dinner next time! Highly recommend it!",177,994,59
The food is really good and the staff are super friendly providing excellent service.,14,85,4
"Went for brunch ordered the chilaquiles and i received it and asked for extra salsa on the side assuming that there was some already on the food but the server said they don't have salsa. So i proceeded to taste it very bland and boring. Not the  chilaquiles i was expecting to get. And the container our water was in had black specks in it. And so we told another employee after we had paid about the food, waited for our Lyft and the server came out and was very hostile and rude to us stating that if we didn't like the food we should've said something and it's very rude towards them and proceeded to flip us off. Mind you he said it with attitude and aggression while i didn't say a word. I paid my tab and still tipped. Tab was expensive and not worth the price. Very unprofessional and rude. Will not return. Didn't catch his name but he has brown hair and a light complexion. Do not recommend at all.",174,908,90
"Outdoor/covered patio? +10 points just for that.My faves here are:Fries with dipping sauce trioSpaghetti, no bacon. Fresh jalapeño, al dente amazingness, tomato sauce, basil, Grana Padano. YUM.I had the warm toffee cake with mascarpone and medjool dates the last time I dropped in for lunch. WOW.Green tea. You get your own little French press action. Pour away. For brunch, I've enjoyed the pizzas (solid) and the chilaquiles (nice take on the original).Service is great.",74,472,20
"I keep coming back the chicken pate, which is only served during dinner, but if you're kind to the waiter and there close to dinner time, they may let your order it for lunch.  Kindness & friendliness can take you far in this town.",44,231,21
"Taste: 4.5Value: 3.5Note to world: many SF restaurant week deals, particularly lunch deals, appear to only be running on the weekend. It would be really helpful if restaurants posted that somewhere in their many advertisements of these promotions, especially if they're ONLY running a lunch special.To our disappointment, we arrived and found that out. Luckily, we didn't wait at all since we made a reservation on open table. And since we found good parking very closeby, we decided to try the brunch. Loco moco was just about the smallest brunch plate I have ever seen. A single patty on top of plain white rice with a sunny side egg. The marinade was some sort of sweet teriyaki and was nothing short of amazing, but not sure I would get this again. We also had the sunny side jo which is the ground beef patty (less flavorful than the loco moco one) in a bed of spinach and onions under two eggs. Potatoes too. A better value comparatively speaking. Service was quick but I almost felt rushed in trying to figure out my order as fast as he kept coming back to check in. Seemed like they just wanted people in and out with the lines though I did appreciate the fast food.",212,1174,80
"Came here to eat with some friends on a Saturday evening before heading to Brewcade down the straight. Such a cute and warm restaurant with a great food selection!We ordered the Garlic Crab Pizza, Mushroom Pizza, Spaghetti, Asian Pear Salad, and Pate with Bread. Every item we ordered was savory and truly delicious! Favorites of the night was the Garlic Crab Pizza, Spaghetti with Pork Belly (Very unique!) and of course the Pate! Our server was also really friendly and gave us a basket of extra bread when we were running low to dip our Pate in. Very attentive and great service!If you're hanging out in the Castro area, then definitely be sure to give Starbelly a try. I would love to come back to try their brunch, which also looks amazing!",132,745,50
"We started out with :TWO"" orders of the house-made **Chicken Liver Pâté, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustard. The birthday girls said she could just eat one herself. One for her and 1 for the 6 other girls. haha! It was super yummy. Very seasoned and smooth. Really enjoy my meal here. Service was good and the atmosphere was cozy. Reservation recommended. Outside seating available with heating lamps. The others small plates we got was their **pan roasted black mussels, Mexican chorizo, market chili & cilantro. I'm not a big fan of mussels but the broth was to die for. I use their bread to soak up the broth. YUM! I'm a french fries lover therefore we got an order of the **house cut fries & three dips and a salad, **regular green salad with cheese. The fries was pretty good, crispy. As for entress, their fresh spaghetti is the best i ever had. Its different, not traditional. With their starbelly bacon, jalapeño, tomato sauce, basil & shaved grana. It's so freaken DELICIOUS!!. The jalapenos and bacon gave it an amazing taste, full of flavor. We ordered 2 pizzas, their **starbelly bacon, jalapeño, arugula & green goddess dressing. Taste like the pasta. Still pretty good. Thin crust and crispy. The arugula added a good fresh touch to it. We also order the **market mushrooms, cave aged gruyere, thyme & roasted onions. I really like this one. Not as much savory taste but i like the way its different mushrooms. Different not a tomato base pizza. My vegetarian friend got their **veggie burger, dried pea & quinoa patty, cucumbers, white bean puree, LTO & curry yogurt. She said it was good. Lots of flavor to her burger.",288,1653,75
"This is a local restaurant for me, literally a half a block from my house.  They have the best patè ever, the grilled bread and onion jam is amazing.  Unfortunately, that's where tonight's meal ended.  The evening started with making me wait outside in the rain for 10 minutes after being told that they would let me know when my order was ready.  I finally went back in and retrieved my order.  The pizza was over cooked and cold when I got it home (1/2 block)!  I realize that they are trying to do their best, but this was not good enough for my money.  I will be back but will only eat in from now on!  I ordered online and showed up at my specified time and then was sent out and then never told to come back in",140,716,66
"Came here for SF Restaurant Week for their $15 lunch menu and I LOVEEEDDD IT!! The portions aren't huge, but it was actually perfect for me and my friends. The pate was the most generous portion and I was definitely find with that!!We also ordered the cauliflower soup which was light and fluffy - would've been great to wet the appetite. Pate was greattttttttttttt - but I LOVE pate generally, so they really couldn't have gone wrong. Extra delicious with mustard and jelly. yum!The fried chicken po' boy was small..like biscuit size. But it was actually better that way because I was going to be comatose for work regardless. Really good, crispy, yummy, juicy chicken..lol! SO GOOD.FINALLY, dessert was the salted pot de creme with a ginger cookie. The dessert was perfectly sweetened and the cookie really did wonders to balance out the whole dessert. Lovelovelovedddd this Restaurant Week menu and all for $20? Heck yeah!",156,925,58
"My friend and I came for lunch one day for Restaurant Week. The deal was $15 for a 3 course meal (what a steal!)I started with the House Made Pate, Fried Chicken Poboy, and finished with the Salted Caramel Pot de Creme. I thoroughly enjoyed all three and wanted more of everything. Service was awesome, and food came out fast. I'm so happy I got to try all of these dishes for such a great price - can't wait for next year already!",83,431,28
The place is lit! Chicken liver is pretty rich and tasty. Margherita pizza is good too but not surprisingly good. It was a bit short of hands on a Friday night.,31,160,12
"I don't understand how this place gets any more than 2 stars, especially in SF. We ordered:- Chicken pâté (Good, flavorful)- Salumi platter (Just okay, nothing special)- French fries (All soggy, not a single crispy fry and sauces were meh)- Bacon pizza (The entire middle of this pizza came out soggy and wet, pretty much disintegrating the crust in the middle/bottom)- Steak with yucca fries (Probably one of the worst, chewiest, inedible, steaks I've ever had. Flavorless, and couldn't even finish one slice. The yucca fries should be called yucky fries. They were as dry as bark. We regret not sending it back.)- Bacon jalapeño spaghetti (My favorite dish of the night - the noodle texture and sauce flavor was delicious, and the jalapeño kick was perfect. The only issue with this one was the several hard pieces of bacon in the dish) - White sangria (Even this was so bland!)In short, I really regret wasting my money here and I am truly confused why people like this place. I think they like the ambience but I definitely will not be wasting a meal here again.",186,1066,63

"We stopped in here on a Saturday night and the place was relatively quiet. We got seated right away and ordered a round of beers. When it came to our order, we got fries, brussel sprouts, the burger, and a margherita pizza to share among 3 of us. The sprouts were excellent and a no-brainer if you like brussel sprouts. The fries were super crispy and the pizza was excellent as well. The best part was the meal was extremely cheap and the food was very satisfying for the price. I'll definitely be back!",94,504,39
"Cute inside but all the food I tried wasn't that good.I got the chorizo + egg pizza, didn't like the toppings but the dough was good.I tried the bacon pizza, I didn't like how the strips of bacon were fatty/chewy and crispy. I would have preferred bacon crumbles instead of bacon strips.The fries, meanwhile, are delicious. I would definitely get the fries again, they're skinny and crispy and flavorful. The pizzas at Doppio Zero on Hayes Street are MUCH better.",80,463,27
"Met up with my girlfriend here for  brunch and  really enjoyed my experience. The restaurant is spacious with a bar, indoor and it's done a seating. There's plenty of natural light inside which I appreciated. We ordered Prosecco and some coffees and they were delivered to the table within 6 minutes, evenn on a busy Saturday. Our server was friendly and the food was delicious. The chicken and waffles were cooked to perfection, and the Italian eggs had a sauce that reminded me of my  Nana's! I'd definitely come back here",91,524,40
"Neighborhood gem. Brunch is fantastic. I love the food, service and the vibe. Couldn't decide between breakfast and pizza so I ordered the chorizo and egg pizza. Solid choice.",29,175,9
"Had a business lunch there, and while it's a little loud for that, the food more than made up for it!One person had the burger, two people had Starbelly salad with steak, and I had the fried chicken po-boy. All I can say ahhh-m-aazzing! The slaw on the po-boy had a light dressing with jalapeños in it and the chicken was perfectly cooked with a light breading. I honestly could have eaten three of these things! That being said, my fries were underwhelming shoestring-ish fries. They weren't bad, but not great either.I wish we could have eaten outside, but that space was reserved by a very large party. Maybe next time...",111,624,48
"*** In Short ***Cozy venue serving up an extensive menu of affordable eats.*** In Depth ***Having made the mistake of driving to the nearby tiki bar despite my friend's warnings about the heavy pours, I was in dire need of food and time to sober up. In came Starbelly to the rescue, where the staff let me in even though I arrived 20 minutes before closing.Hungry as I was, my waitress did warn me that their servings were pretty generous, so I had to taper down the greediness that my eyes felt perusing their menu, settling for their supposedly famous bacon spaghetti, which, while tasty, would have benefited from a bit more noodles to balance out the generous portions of bacon (or, you know, less bacon, but why would you do that?!)Definitely planning to come back to try more of the menu, but the pasta alone earns them a solid 3.5 stars for now!***Accessibility Info***Venue - Spacious, with a mix of seating, plenty of which are accessible.Bathroom - Didn't try them.",171,975,69
"My first time having brunch here was a delight.  There were so many things on the menu that I had a hard time deciding what to have.  I didn't pause though on the Strawberry Alarm Clock cocktail.  Mmmmm, that was good!My husband went with the loco moco, which I was thinking about.  He then strongly suggested the chicken and waffles, I'm guessing more because he wanted to try it.  I mean, I love chicken and waffles too, but I really needed to change up my brunch game.  I decided on the chilaquiles, which I haven't had in a long time.  Our server was very friendly and when I asked to add an egg, she mistakenly said the chilaquiles came with it.  When my dish came out without it, she was right there to admit that it was her first day and she was still getting used to the menu and being on her own.  No worries, she quickly placed an order for my eggs and it came out quickly to add with my dish.  The chilaquiles was good both with and without the egg and I'd probably make a trip here if I'm ever in the mood for it again.  I only got a small bite of the loco moco, which means it was probably really good since my husband ate it so quickly.Going early was great as we got a table right away and didn't have to deal with the brunch crowd that gathered as we were leaving.  I'm looking forward to another trip to Starbelly, especially hoping we get the same server as she was so nice on her first day.",273,1409,127
"Food is consistently delicious, but also wanted to shout out the very safe-feeling parklet dining that include plastic barriers between tables, covered seating as well as above head heaters. Waiters and staff were also very Covid-safe. Cannot recommend enough for folks who are very Covid-safe.",45,294,18
"Dear Starbelly,I understand it's Covid and you want to make money off of turning your tables quickly. Thanks for telling me that multiple times.Diners beware that the restaurant has a strict dining time limit that they enforce religiously. Be prepared for your waiter to start rushing you out the door 45 minutes before the end of an arbitrary time limit (they tell you after you sit down) and start pushing you out. Rude and pushy attitudes included.No consideration given if the restaurant serves your food and drinks late. Dining time is also supposed to encompass the diner packing up their food. Maybe you can give a courtesy heads up that you expect me to chug the cocktail you just served me.Star belly, fix your attitude and your system.",128,745,55

"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in SF. We came for my boyfriend's birthday last night in a party of 6 and from the first moment we spoke to the hostess, she was extremely rude and curt with us and seemed to consistently berate us for being 10 mins late even though the table wasn't even ready after our party had arrived. They also told us we had only 90 mins to eat but then did not bring us our 2nd course of food until 75 mins into the dinner so we had to rush to eat. The hostess/waitress consistently berated is throughout the evening. Wished I read the previous reviews about service here. Really don't understand why they would treat people this way especially since this was for a birthday celebration. Called the manager to calmly explained the situation, but it was the same attitude. Highly do not recommend and will not be coming back.",158,860,72
"Starbelly is what I would call a hidden gem.  It's located just slightly off the main thoroughfare and I would not have known of this place if it weren't for a friend taking us there.My friends and stopped by after attending an event at the Castro Theatre.  It was fairly late on a weekday but they had availability so off we went!Starbelly has a decent sized menu with plenty of options for diners.  One friend and I each chose to order a pizza while another chose the burger.  I chose the pizza Margherita with an added topping of mushrooms.  The crust was thin and had some chew.  The pizza was flavorful and its ingredients fresh.   My friends also enjoyed their meals.  The dishes are simply prepared and allow for the ingredients to shine.While the food here is good, the staff and the service really stand out.  Patrons consisted of couples and groups on my visit.  It's a nice spot to meet up and have a good time.",168,922,75
"I got here on a Monday right around noon and it was pretty empty, or maybe everyone was in the back, but I got seated immediately for two. The vibe is unassuming and quite nice. Service was quick right at the beginning, but when we needed to look the menu over a bit longer, it felt like we were forgotten about for a while and had to actively wave someone down to order. I ordered the chilaquiles. It was served with a side house salad which was good as a side. Simple, and easy. The chilaquiles were quite good. A nice crunch a covered in flavor, though I did kinda want more sour cream everywhere or maybe a lime as it could've used a bit more acidity. Still quite good. I had a taste of my friend's Loco moco and it was a very interesting play on the Hawaiian dish. The sauce (usually gravy) was light and tangy. It caught me off guard, so I'm not sure if I really liked the variation. Honestly the burger patty wasn't that impressive either. All in all, a good experience. Not the best brunch in town, but at least the food was sold and there was no wait at all.",207,1067,91
"always, always a fine experience.  lovely menu and gracious service.  i'm a huge fan.",14,85,3
"Great food but service was questionable. We made a reservation and were seated right away. We ordered drinks and a couple pizzas as appetizers. They brought our drinks , appetizers and mains all at once. We were still enjoying our dinner and they brought the bill. They didn't ask if we wanted dessert or any after dinner drinks.I asked if we could still order a round of drinks even though they closed us out and they yes but you only have 15 minutes left and we have a reservation for this table.We were there less than an hour. I won't be back just for the fact that they rushed us out",111,588,53
"Nice ambiance, that's it. Definitely not kid friendly. We made a reservation ahead of time. When we arrived with 2 strollers, they still put us in the back in the super crowded patio on a table shared with another group while the entire front of the restaurant was empty. I couldn't tie my toddler's booster chair onto their trendy chairs so I had to use one of their high chairs which was filthy like it had been sitting next to a dumpster.I ordered the Sunnyside Joe's which was basically a regular ground beef patty with a few sunny side up eggs and hella cheese piled on top which took over the whole dish. The potatoes on the side were crispy, dry and over cooked. On a positive note, the coffee was really good.",133,717,54

"I always seem to be the happiest when I'm in the beautiful city . To me, San Francisco is not only liberal, but also a judgement free zone , a place where you can find amazing and unique types of cuisine, and a place where you can experience winter during the summertime . One of my favorite places would have to be star belly . Sure, it can easily be mistaken for a place only hipsters would go to but, trust me! The food will distract you and put you in a daze . The first time I had it was when we got into town pretty late and my cousin wanted to take us out for a late dinner.  She raved about how she and her gfs often go there during lunch breaks and how the docs way burger was featured on a food network show . Mm burgers always sound like a good idea ! We arrived around 10 P.M. with no sight of a packed restaurant . That's always a good sign, imo. We got seated right away, and were given sparkling waters upon request . Believe it or not, sparkling water really clears the palette better than regular agua :) after seeing their drink menu , I was really intrigued by their lavender lemonade . I don't think I could ever get tired of lavender . It's in my diffuser at home , it puts me in a relaxed mood, and thanks to Starbelly it's one of my favorite drinks ! We all shared a kale Caesar and bacon pizza to start . The reason why it took me so long to review this place is because I was in food heaven this whole time and just recently came back . Sorry, guys ! Let me just say that you can never go wrong with the menu items that contain "" bacon jalapeño "" here at Starbelly . The pizza contains a tasty red sauce , bacon , cheese, and fresh arugula sprinkled on top . A for presentation and a plus for the taste . All of that yummy stuff sat on a thin cracker crust which allows you to soak up all the great flavors of the toppings instead of getting too overwhelmed if it were to have a thick doughy crust . They definitely compliment each other like colors ;) The kale Caesar wasn't too heavy as they were pretty easy on the dressing and cheese . Their dressing is made in house and they use Dino kale ! Pretty fresh and vibrant . My boyfriend ordered the docs way burger and it did not disappoint whatsoever ! I was able to take a bite and understand why it was featured on television. The duck pate on the burger is out of this world ! MUST. TRY.!  Review PT 2: Just last night , my friends from the city wanted to catch up and have a celebratory dinner for my friend and I. ( it was my friends one year post brain surgery anniversary and my 3 week post surgery anniversary ) it was my turn to choose where to eat so, I chose star belly ! Making a reservation for 7 was quick and easy . We immediately got seated and Annie, our server took our drink orders right away . After raving about their lavender lemonade, my girls decided to order it that night .Since my picky little cousins joined us too, we ordered the house cut fries appetizer for them, and a customized pizza . Something very close to a pepperoni pizza, please ! No problem at all, they were able to do it :) My boyfriend and I were still very full from off the grid so we ended up sharing a kale Caesar and bacon jalapeño spaghetti . According to Rodney H, their spaghetti is famous lol . Those spaghetti noodles were cooked to al dente perfection ! That dish is tdf! Oh so warm and comforting ! I was in all "" mmmmmms."" That night . My friend ordered it too and had the same feelings about it . After inhaling all our delicious meals, we had a sweet tooth and decided on ordering three types of dessert to share . We opted for : warm toffee cake, a scoop of the secret breakfast ice cream, and the rice pudding . The toffee cake won my heart that night . As my friends said "" it was an orgasmic virginal experience "" whoops! Inappropriate! Lol the secret breakfast was divine ! I'd have it for breakfast every morning if I could . The rice pudding was rich, creamy, and tart from the cherries . It was a very comforting dish . We ended up all leaving with smiles on our faces and parties in our tummys. Thanks for the night to remember , belly of a star !",821,4142,315
"We went here on a Sunday, so we knew what to expect crowd wise. The place doesn't have much standing room if you're waiting for a table. Probably better to make a reservation ahead of time. The main table are those large communal tables, where you might be seated next to a stranger. Not much of liquor selection for a brunch location. I ended up getting a beer. The food was good, and had great presentation. I'm only a bit turned off by this place because my collegue's fork was spotty, and the person next to me had strand of hair on her plate. In their defense, they did replace those items, but it wasn't enough for me to visit a second time.",123,647,58
"The space is beautiful, all weathered wood and a gorgeous back patio. I ordered the French toast with fruit compote, marscapone and pistachios. It was rich and well balance with sweet and savory flavors. My friend got the corn pizza which was also delicious. I would definitely go for brunch again.",51,298,15
Requested a patio seating on a  reservation  24 hrs  earlierbut when we showed up we were informed the patio was  reservedfor a  graduation?    Poor mans choice  was the  seating in the street area. Still not a fan of this as it feels unsafe with angry  speeding traffic most of the time.Staff was  chaotic  but tried real hardFood and pricing very goodChecking in     seating and  getting  drinks seemed to be the most  chaotic,75,428,35
"Starbelly has great outdoor seating with heaters and plants that make you feel cozy. Good service and not too loud. Waitress was super nice and offered to make a custom lavender latte ~.  4.5/5 vibes5/5 serviceChilaquiles were good, but the chips were too soggy. The salad that came with it was good but didn't really compliment the chilaquiles - would have preferred another flavor to go with the chips.Jalapeño arugula bacon pizza was flavored amazingly and had a very good crust. The center of the pizza was droopy so made it hard to distribute.The ratio of chicken to waffles was perfect but was a little dry and could have used more syrup. Bread was really soft and nice! Cake of donut was light and airy but passionfruit overwhelmed so couldn't taste chocolate really. 3.5/5 food",135,785,56
"Starbelly consistently churns out top notch, quality food with a focus on local ingredients and originality. What I really appreciate is that the menu offers something for everyone in my family's varying tastes.The back patio has that perfect inside/outside balance and is a great place to take kids on a weekend late-morning. We approve!",54,338,19
I don't know why I ever try to return to this restaurant. The staff is obnoxiously rude and entitled. The espresso machine is habitually broken The seating is cramped and filthy with soot from the street.,36,204,13
"OBSESSED with this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time for date night, we've come with friends, we've taken my parents, we love it.The sangria is a must, as are the dumplings (a little pricey for only three, but absolutely incredible) and the chorizo and egg pizza. The pizzas are super well-priced, the apps are a bit on the expensive end but it all evens out. Great vibe, great service, cool location, see you there!",78,431,31
"Stopped by bc a certain place down the street had a crazy long line as per usje. No wait at the communal tables here! PROS: Cute ambiance and overall vibes; playing 90s-early 00s music, I dig it. Menu has cool sounding items such as loco moco, chilaquiles, fried chicken and waffles  Portion are good sized  Prices are fair. Side note, adding on avocado is $2 and it's like half an avocado! that's a great price CONS: Hot. No AC and I was there during that ridiculous labor day weekend heat Service is... leisurely The fried chicken po boy had very little flavor other than the spice of the jalepeno. Bland. Fries were soggy While the food items sounded good for the most part they were underwhelming. French toast, OK. Joe's eggs, OK. Chilaquiles were probably the best thing. An ""A-OK"" backup brunch option",143,808,43
So happy to come here today for some lunch! The staff were friendly and were super trained on keeping the space clean and sanitizing! Tables were at a 6 ft distance! Their food as always is outstanding! Thanks Guys!,39,215,15
"Beautiful Day in SF and wanted to try something new. Starbelly was where we decided to go. It was very busy which always good when your trying out a new place. I got the French toast with fried chicken. Every bite gave me life!! Mimosas here are good not bottomless but that's okay. If your in the Castro area definitely stop in here but first check to see if you can get a reservation, you don't want to be outside waiting at this hot spot but then again you don't want to miss out dinning!! Just go!!! Your love it.",100,517,45
this is one of my favorite places in the city. It's a great place for cocktails and dinner. The service is always very friendly and quick. I recommend the pizza. The appetizers are all very good. You might want to make reservations.,42,232,17
"I really didn't want to post this, but I was a patron the same evening as Kris and Faith and witnessed the entire conversation.  We were the two Asian guys at the table closest to the wall behind Faith.I, too, am a person of color and while I can empathize about what it's like to be racially profiled and singled out, to be fair, they were informing the table of four next to you quite often also. That table of four also wasn't all white. While I will stand up to injustices, we also have to acknowledge and take responsibility for our own actions. There are signs all over the restaurant stating that one must wear masks at all times. There was even an ordinance that was implemented stating 'unless your fork is on its way to your mouth OR the cup is about to hit your lips, your masks have to be on.' Well, that isn't verbatim to the ordinance, but I'm sure you get it. We didn't get spoken to at all about our masks because we followed the rules. So much so that instead of re-hooking my ear the forty times I did (that's over exaggerated) with the band, I wiped my mouth and held my mask over my face to chew and talk. It's called compassion. These employees are literally risking their health and safety to feed you. The least we can do as a community is take care of them as they do the same for us.To be a service worker having to implement these rules must be uncomfortable. I'm also making an assumption here regarding that but I know it would be for me because I have to do the same working in healthcare. So if I can make a recommendation, have some compassion and follow the rules. And trust, I get it. We all want to eat out and enjoy our meals, but laughing loudly without a mask on is like sneezing without covering your mouth; the spit can still fly everywhere and we can all be at risk.Be responsible and take care of each other during this time. This world needs more of it right now.And a big thank you to ALL the service workers. I appreciate you.  And really, what can I say about the food? The food has always been consistent. My favorite item is the pate. I like getting extra bread because the pate piece is always huge! Also, that evening we got the fries, Brussels sprouts, dumplings, pizza, steak, salmon, and two creme de pots. All of which again, were tasty. Did I mention it was just two of us? We like to eat and I look forward to dinner there again soon.",455,2389,211
"I came to Starbelly recently with my brother and his friends for brunch.  I think it is located near or in the Castro (don't hate the visitor....lol). Our party was immediately seated upon entering.  We were seated in the entrance area.  There appears to be a larger seating area in the back which looks good for larger groups (I.e more than 6 individuals). The brunch menu to me looked a little small for choices to choose from.  However, they did have fried chicken and waffles and a Hawaiian loco moco.  My LA side wanted me to order the fried chicken and waffles.  My Hawaiian side wanted me to order the loco moco.   Was a tough choice.   I ended up ordering the loco moco.   For those who have not had a loco moco before, it is a beef patty with egg and gravy over rice.  In Hawaii, it is a big dish.   Starfish's version was not.   The loco moco had all the elements to make it except it was only with one scoop rice and one egg.  I am accustom to 2 scoops rice and 2 eggs which is the norm in Hawaii.   Thus, my expectations got the best of me.  The beef patty was cooked well as I ordered it and my egg was sunny side up.   It was good, but it can't beat the original from Hawaii.    I was chatting to the lady next to me and she ordered the chicken and waffles.   She said it was good.  It consisted of deep friend lightly breaded chicken breasts served with 2 waffles.   It looked good and I wanted to take a pic of it but felt awkward since it would be disturbing her while she was eating. The service here is good.   I will give them credit for customer service as one of our parties order did not arrive with the rest of the orders and came out late.  They comped their mistake.   The drinks looked good here.",340,1723,135
"I've been dining at Starbelly for over 5 years and every time I go, it's always consistent and good. The menu is unique but not too eclectic where your scratching your head wondering what you just ordered unlike many other San Francisco restaurants. With that said, I suggest ordering the Loco Moco. It's a perfect entrée if your looking for something hardy, yet comfortable. The pizzas at Starbelly are fantastic as well. If you are going for brunch, I suggest the Chorizo and sunny egg. It makes for a unique take on what pizza should taste like for breakfast or for brunch. Their drink list is also delightful and reasonably priced. Nothing beats a fun sparkling rosé or a tasty cocktail with fantastic food!",124,711,46
"Tucked away in the Mission is this little place.  It's less than a mile away from 16th St. Bart.  Several of us were going to get dinner together and we were a party of seven.  It was chilly that day and we were seated in the very back in the tented area.  Fortunately, there were blaring heat lamps that made it very warm and comfy.  I even had to take off several layers.  This restaurant is a little cramped, but by extending it using the bungalow-type arrangement, it increases space by a ton. It has a cute, classy, yet organic pub feel - very SF. I ordered the Timberline to start and it was delicious and topped with rosemary.  Because I had eaten a late lunch, I decided to order the mussels.  Though it's an appetizer, it's pretty large (but still smaller than a main entrée). It is pan fried and cooked with chorizo, which flavored the dish oh so well.  It was the perfect amount for me.  I also tried some of Boyfriends steak.  It was so soft and delicious.  Definitely would recommend (though it's a little pricy).  The pizza that some others had gotten was large, but had a very thin crust (think pieology thin). Don't have any complains really.  We did notice that the heat lamps got to be a bit too warm, but I would rather that than be too cold. Very cute place! Definitely would want to try to come back if I'm in the area and I would recommend to friends.Ambiance: 4/5Food and Drink: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Overall Experience: 4/5",264,1442,108
"Starbelly has long been a beloved brunch spot for me, and today we came for dinner with some friends, our toddler, and our baby. It was such a wonderful dining experience all around. Setting: We ate on the covered, cozy lit, and heated patio, which was perfect for a brisk SF evening. Service: The staff was friendly as always, though I especially appreciated them tonight with our kiddos. The adults in our party were taking a while deciding (everything looked delish!), and the manager went out of his way to take our toddler's order first to get it started. Her order was ready before the rest of us even finished ordering and probably saved us from a hangry meltdown. They were also great about helping us find a good spot for our stroller, and generally just made all of us at ease. Food: So good, per usual. Our small group went family-style on a bunch of things: (going from fav to less memorable)* Halibut: Each component of the dish was fresh and well tended to. The crisp yet tender halibut was a winner. * Spaghetti: My toddler's order, but all the adults loved it too. Super flavorful, perfectly done noodles, and huge hunks of bacon.* Burrata + grilled stonefruit: SO good. The mix of textures and flavors was wonderful. I could eat this every day.* Italian sausage + polenta: I'm not a sausage person, but my dinner mates really enjoyed it.* Starbelly salad: A nice compliment to everything above, with super fresh ingredients, but otherwise a pretty basic salad.  * Mussels: The sauce and the bread were great, but the mussels themselves were overcooked and shriveled. Our happy hour drinks were also great, esp. for the price (my yummy pint of lager was $5!)Love the friendly vibe, welcoming staff, cozy (yet airy) space, and delicious food.",306,1757,103
"Favorite restaurant in SF. Good vibes, good food, and at a very reasonable price. Can't go wrong.Patio area is chill too.",21,121,6
Tasty place in the Castro with friendly staff and good service.  Big outdoor patio in the back of the restaurant (although still very enclosed...something to note when restaurants start reopening for outdoor dining).,33,216,12
"Very good food and ambiance. I'm from the south and I know flavors, the food here is definitely packing flavor.",20,111,7
"This is easily one of, if not the best meal we've ever eaten. I cannot recommend this place enough!",19,99,5
"Highlights of our meal include the fried chicken PO' boy sandwich with jalapeño and slaw, the starbelly bacon pizza (we added sopressata + mushrooms) as well as the mezcal margarita. We also truly enjoyed the starbelly salad. The service was great and they surprised us at the end of our meal with the salted caramel pot de creme.",58,330,19
"THE STAFF HERE ARE RACIST!!!!!!!! Don't come here, especially as a person of color during this COVID-19 pandemic. The staff here will single you out and won't even let you eat your food, while YES I WILL SAY IT, they will let the WHITE privilege get away with NOT wearing their masks while doing absolutely nothing. Yet they want my family to eat their food WITH their mask on at the same time. Does that make any sense?And also, I got to try the food and it tasted like absolute shit. How the f*ck did it taste bad with NO flavor? Do you KNOW how bad food has to be to taste disgusting with no flavor. If you want to enjoy a RACIST meal, by all means, go ahead. But let me at least the save the money and time for those who will pay for a racist experience. It's really sad.",152,775,64
"Asian racism is alive and well at Starbelly....how is that possible???? Ate there tonight with my sister from Hawai'i and we were the only 2 people there who were constantly harassed about wearing a mask...even during dinner service.  The white 4 top next to us along with the white 2 top to our right, were all NOT wearing masks during dinner service.  But they were never asked to put one on, just the two of us.  When I raised my hand and made a case as to why they weren't asked to wear a mask after 10 minutes of observing in silence, the manager came over and said  ""some people just don't listen"".  So I asked him ""so then why are you at our table and not theirs??"".  We paid a $130 tab for the two of us so you know we were not there to just sit and absorb space.  But after this incident, I'd challenge any person of color who truly cares about racial and social injustice to think twice about funding a restaurant who will willfully treat people this way in during these sensitive times.",188,997,90
"STAY AWAY!!! Deceptive business practice and horrible management!!  I'm seated here now at 12:30 pm on Sunday (1/27) for Restaurant Week, but they  are absolutely refusing to honor the Restaurant Week price THEY are advertising!!! I spoke directly to the manager (Ian) who flippantly admitted that it was an error on THEIR part that there is absolutely no indication anywhere that their Restaurant Week menu is only being offered on the weekdays.  He said  it was brought to his attention yesterday, by a couple of customers.  He apologized, but was adamant and said there was absolutely no way he could make an exception. He said he could serve the items from the Restaurant Week menu, but only at the regular price. Seriously? The special menu was for a measly $15.00 per person. I guess they obviously feel $15.00 isn't worth their reputation. Ok, I learned my lesson about how this place is managed and hope you'll learn from my very disappointing experience, and stay away!The only upside was that I asked about the Restaurant Week Menu before placing our order. To add insult to injury, Ian just came back to our table and reinforced that he wouldn't honor the Restaurant Week pricing, and gave us a donut instead. We're leaving!We were just at Canela'a Bistro and Wine Bar last night on Saturday, a weekend night, and they honored their Restaurant Week pricing. I think Starbelly did this bait and switch deliberately just to lure people in.  If they realized this was a so-called  ""mistake"" on their part, why not easily rectify it by honoring the $15.00 offer for just two people, that THEY advertised? Unethical  and not at all customer-centric.  Starbelly doesn't deserve your patronage!  I'm sure this lack of customer focus extends  to all aspects of their business practices. There are way too many excellent restaurants all over the Castro for bad treatment! Try Canela's for one, on Market Street.  DO NOT come to Starbelly!!!",326,1942,138
"People are often extra critical of 3.5 Yelp rated restaurants on Yelp. To be honest, I have alot of favorite 3.5 star rated restaurants; I also dislike alot of 4-5 star restaurants and think they're overrated.Bottom line: 3.5 STARS for Starbelly - they have some good eats and are reasonably priced! I would definitely return for a few items and recommend you give it a shot yourself. They have a nice heated outdoor patio which I imagine is perfect for brunch. Reservations are easy online, and it's good for big groups. I have walked by on weekend mornings and noticed there was no line either.As for the food, there were highlights and low lights at Starbelly, and overall I think that the value and taste it was really good. * TIMBERLINE ($7) - 3.5 STARS:Well, I admit I'm a cocktail snob. This one was pretty, and tasted nice with a strong rosemary note, but wasn't as tasty as a few of my other favorite restaurant cocktail bars. Namely: Beretta, Locanda, Range. In the Castro however, I haven't found a good restaurant cocktail bar yet. What a steal though - only $7 - unheard of prices!* PATE ($12) - 4 STARS:house made chicken liver pâté, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustardThis pate is done right. It's a little harder and more crumbly than some but served as a thick slice and with a few pieces of toasted sliced bread.* MUSSELS ($12) - 3 STARS:pan roasted black mussels, Mexican chorizo, market chili & cilantroThis is a small bowl of very tiny mussels. The broth was uninspiring.* BURRATA ($9) - 4 STARS:burrata di stefano, blistered cherry tomato & basil pureeI love burrata and this was no exception. * Side of: CAULIFLOWER ($6) - 3 STARS:marinated mixed cauliflower, chili flakes, shaved red onion & chivesTasted very vinegary, but fresh, simple, and homemade. A somewhat small portion and not unique so I would not order again.* BAVETTE STEAK ($25) - 3.5 STARS:Very nicely cooked (requested medium rare, but the chef recommends medium), tender and flavorful. The sauce/marinade was not my cup of tea.* CRAB GARLIC NOODLES ($21) - 4 STARS:local Dungeness crab, garlic noodle & garlic breadReally decadent and rich crab sauce with a fresh made doughy noodle. Really delicious and filling.* SEA SALT POT DE CREME ($8) - 4 STARS:A decent portion of creamy luscious sea salt pot de creme, served with 2 rosemary shortbread cookies. I was not a huge fan of the cookies, they were thin and crumbly and didn't have enough butter, but I really enjoyed the pot de creme. It was smooth and not especially thick, yet still very creamy.",442,2558,129
Not great experience. Made a reservation for outdoor seating -pandemic and all. They refused to seat us outdoors even tho if they'd seated us right away we'd have been finished before their noise ordinance issue. We offered to sit inside at an open window after being ignored for 15 mins. Food was meh at best. No apology for the mix up or lack of accommodation.,65,362,22
"Meh basically sums itCocktails look nice but are not really good, service is ok minus, and the food is not bad, but nothing special.The atmosphere is nice though.",28,162,10
"I really like this brunch spot, it's absolutely pretty, the nature asthenic is really cute. When I walked in I really liked there set up, spacious (in terms of crowded SF) I ordered the French toast, which was good. I liked they included pistachio to bring more flavor. The rest of the order was:Veggie burger - good, just the patty was a little dry, which make sense since it's not meat. Italian eggs - the sauce was really goodMushroom pizza - white sauce which I liked a lot. French express coffee - it was strong and flavorful, not bitter can drink without sugar. I would recommend it, if you a coffee person.  The prices seem pricy, but it's normal for SF. The portions are large, which makes sense.",128,704,39
The customer service is very good. The guy at the front that manages the pick up orders is really nice. I highly recommend the corn cheese pizza with added bacon..fucking BOMB. One of the best pizzas I've ever had in my laife,42,225,15
"Came back for lunch. The little gem lettuce Caesar was nice. It comes with avocado, but the lettuce is served in big chunks--any cooking show with world class chefs state that caesar should be torn bite-sized. It was still good though. The housemade pate is delicious but the bread they serve with it is too sweet. A traditional baguette would be so much better, even crackers would be better. They serve it with jam which is okay but cornichons would be so much better.",84,470,30
"I dropped by at 6:30 pm on Monday 7/4, & it was busy but not insane. A nice server brought sparkling water which was complimentary. Many places charge extra so this was cool. It took a long time to be served. I ordered an entree of bavette (basically flank steak.) it came with fried potatoes not smashed which was not great. And they knew it. So they brought me white bean puree which was tasty. Still a nice baked potato would have been better. This place should try & just put out consistent food. Our server Megan was terrific.",99,531,35
"Ambitious to start off San Francisco Restaurant Week, a coworker and I decided to go to Starbelly for our first of many food adventures for the next ten days. We chose Starbelly for it's affordable menu options and value. The menu seemed not to have changed much since last year. AMBIANCE was hipsterly cute as we were seated in the heated patio decorated with a striped tent overhead, hanging lights and plants adorning the walls. FOOD was medicore by San Francisco standards. The kitchen went light on the spices and salt on all the dishes. The coleslaw on the fried chicken sandwich could have used a kick, and the chicken could have been brined or the crust seasoned. I'm not a fan of pate but it was the best dish of the meal. The bread was great quality and the mustard and fruit spread went well with the pate.",149,817,60

"We arrived and we're promptly greeted by the hostess who sat us almost immediately. The server (girl with red hair) greeted us and  told us she would give us time and came back shortly there after with water. She took our drink and food order at the same time. Little did I know this would be the last time we would see her until we were finished with our meal. Someone else brought our drinks and our food. Never once were we checked on, at any point. No one came to offer more water (we got up and refilled it ourselves). No one checked on us after we got our food. We finished and sat there for a solid 10 mins with completely finished plates in front of us. I know our server saw us because I watched her walk by several times and check on the table next to us. When she came to clear our plates she finally offered us another round of drinks. Well, no... We are done. I would have ordered another one 20 mins ago had you ever come to check on us. I personally wouldn't recommend this place until they get their service standards under control. The food was good, but not good enough to deal with such subpar service.",216,1121,82
best pizza i've had in a long time. we got the seasonal corn pizza and the chicken poboy sandwich which was delicious as well. the coleslaw was perfectly crisp and had a hint of lime and the fresh jalapeño slices really completed the sandwich. the service was really good and everyone was friendly! definitely would recommend !,57,327,23
"I was really looking forward to this and it broke my heart how bland all the food was. I was there 6/28 for lunch and had the loco moco. I went and fetched salt and hot sauce to spike up the flavor but it did not really help.  At the end of my meal, the next table asked for my salt for their margherita pizza.Like I said, I had high expectations but it was a big let down.",78,373,37
"My first time here.I'm definitely coming back especially for their spaghetti!Tastes differently awesome!!!My brother and nephew would love it!Service was great, too!Been back a number of times already, and I still enjoy their dishes, especially the Starbelly Spaghetti!",38,269,9

"My roommate made reservations for 3 and then day of our other roommate decided to join so we contacted them right away. Starbelly was very accommodating especially for a Friday night. We arrived on time and were seated right away at one of their high top communal tables (two people on each side). I understand why these types of tables are popular (easy to seat random size groups quickly and they don't encourage people to stay too long since they are loud and not super comfortable). But we had a reservation and the restaurant has plenty of regular tables. The communal table is right next to the open kitchen area and right in the middle of the restaurant. It's incredibly loud, like to the point where we stopped trying to talk among the four of us and instead just talked to the person sitting next to us. The server had to ask the part of our group that was sitting opposite her to speak louder because she couldn't hear their order. She could have gone all the way around the table to get their order but that would have been super awkward. If the server couldn't get their order imagine how the conversation was with the four of us trying to yell to hear each other. We ordered a few drinks and I split a pizza with one of my roommates. The drinks, food and service would get 4 stars but the atmosphere here was completely undesirable to me. I would be open to giving this place another shot but with so many restaurants in the area with much better atmospheres I think it might be a while.",278,1500,123
"Went here for a bachelorette party and they were so accommodating with our large size party. The outside patio is beautiful. The food was really good and three pizzas, two pastas, and a salad fed all 8 women very nicely. The one scurry thing (literally, it scurried) was when the giant rat was trotting around towed the other perimeter. Yikes.",60,343,23
The setup of the place is great. I always sit in their back patio area. Apparently they've recently received noise complaints from the neighboring apartments so they have to close the patio by 9pm. Food is OK. Pizzas are not the best i've had. Tried one of their salads and the house cured salmon (also just ok),57,311,22
"I came here for brunch, and it was quite busy so I'm glad I made a reservation. Starbelly is close to public transit so for someone without a car, it was easy for me to get to.The brunch menu isn't very extensive but has a good variety. I was debating between the chilaquiles and the chorizo pizza and decided to go for the chilaquiles since I didn't want to eat pizza for brunch.The chilaquiles was huge and really good! I liked that it comes with salad so that it doesn't feel like a completely unhealthy meal. I do wish that there was less chips or everything wasn't mixed in already because at the end of my meal, I was trying to pick off all the toppings since I couldn't finish the chips. But this is definitely one of the better chilaquiles I've had before so I'd recommend it!",148,784,70
"I am so disappointed because we saw many good reviews on yelp. The service wasn't good they were very rude. If you don't wanna eat sandwiches they don't have that much option. I ordered lamb, it came lamb sausage even did not tell you on menu. I don't understand such good rating place but there is no quality at all. Won't came back!!",63,335,27
"I used to go to Starbelly often before COVID And liked their menu . However, I went there tonite and was disappointed to see how mediocre their food has become. The lovely dumplings which was their signature dish was small, flat and tasteless.  Their salad was not fresh and boring and their pizza was a soggy  runny tomato sauce swimming in a tasteless cheese!  I will delete this place from my SF favorites!",73,409,29
"Came here for a lunch in their beautiful back patio. We were seated promptly with our reservation and our orders were taken quickly. We got our drinks but our food took a little while. We didn't complain or make any comment, it was a beautiful day and we weren't in a rush. Perhaps it's because I'm now visibly pregnant (or just good self-awareness by the staff) the manager came by to apologize for the delay with our food and offered to bring us some complimentary drinks. Our server also apologized for the wait. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal when it arrived, the starbelly bacon pizza is soooooooo good! When our bill came, the server had also taken care of our entrees, a kind gesture. We would have been happy to pay for our delicious food, but this attention to detail and care toward their customers will put Starbelly even higher on our lunch rotation. Thanks for a lovely, relaxing meal!",160,898,70
"Don't even know where to start.  I was excited to come back after loving the place pre Covid.  Hosted a party of 9.  Restaurant wasn't too busy.  The waiter was obviously stoned out of his mind.  Couldn't remember anything.  Apps arrived. Fries were so undercooked and greasy we sent them back, twice.  Other apps of pate was good, but small amount of bread, asked for more, three times.  Nada.  Waiter skipped three of the people when placing the order for mains.  When we walked up to ensure he had the remaining orders he was spaced out.  Meals arrived for half the table.  It took 20 minutes for the other half of guests.   The pizza that was suppose to be well done was doughy. Overall it is a mere showdown of its former self. Food was not great.  We ordered wine, they brought the wrong ones, twice. I don't know if it was the stoned waiter, the cooks or just entire staffs just inability to care about anything.  What bothers me is that it used to be my favorite spot.  I guess I need to move on.",187,1004,76
"Intimate vibes, great music, and fantastic service. Seriously. I forgot what our server's name was, but he was one of the best servers I've had in a LONG time. He gave us the right amount of attention and made us feel extremely welcomed and comfortable at the restaurant. So comfortable that he was able to convince a few people in the group to eat stuff that they typically wouldn't. Heck... we gave him the liberty to order whatever he thought was best and surprise us LOL I don't remember everytthinnng we had, but I do remember really enjoying the mussels and pate. Everything was good, to be completely honest. There wasn't a single dish out of the possibly 10 we had that we didnt like. Their cocktails were also really good! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try :)",141,787,56
"Starbelly: Left these Bellies EmptyHave eaten here before and it was a good experience: great food, pretty attentive wait staff, and good vibes all around. However came back here just today with a reservation, and when we showed up on time, we're initially ignored and not even welcomed in. Then one of the hostesses asks for time of the reservation and the name it's under, and once we tell her, she looks a bit flustered and tells us that our table is being prepared. We go and wait outside for 15 minutes, and a whole other new host (the one who didn't even welcome us in when we first got there) comes up and asks us if we even have a reservation. We again tell him the time and name and he also tells us, okay your table just needs to get bussed. Mind you, while we have been waiting outside, another party of 3 (same as my party) shows up later than we do, and then they proceed to be seated before us. So we left because our stomachs were growling.",182,955,83
